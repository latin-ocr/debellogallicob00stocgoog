From another poet, Lucilius, we gather that the ‘veles’ vas
the same as the ‘rotarius’ that he carneo five ‘hastae' and
wore a golden belt-

‘innque hastae, aureolo cinctu rorariu’ velea'

We may also fairly infer his identity with the ‘accensus velatus'
from another line of the same author-

‘Pone paludatus tubat rorariu' velox'

though we are under no necessity ol connecting ‘veles’ ety-
mologically with ‘velatus'

These nimhle light infantry were of special use against
elephants. We find them so employed in the First Punic War
(Polyb. i. 33, (9), at the battle ol the Trebia (ac. 218, Liv. xxi.
55, §nl and again (Liv. xxx. 33, (3) at Zama (sc. aoa),
where they vvere posted in the gaps between the maniplos, to
tempt the beasts under a double fire. On ordinary occasions
the ‘velites’ were stationed partly among the ‘antesigani’ and
partly behind the standards ¹.

The ‘velites' are onlled by Polybius γροσφομᾶχοι (h 33, δ 9 3
vi. ar, 5 7) or γροσφοφόροι (νὶ. ar, § 9), and are described by
him much in the same way as they are by Livy as carrying
a round buckler (πόρμη), three feet in diameter, and being
armed with a stvord¹ and with light spears (γρόσφοι). He adds
that their head-gear was generally plain, but occasionally covered
nitu wolf-skin, partly lor protection, and partly to dravi the
attention of the obicem, and let them see whether they vvere
playing their pact mauhtlly. The γρόσφοε or ‘hasta' is described
by him as having a shalt three feet long and of a finger' s breadth
and a point aspan long, so attenuated as to break at the first
cast and prove useless to the enemy.
