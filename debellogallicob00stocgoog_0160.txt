were wrapped in mystery and a region ol lable. We are told
ol islanda iu the Baltic where there were men with horses' legs,
who were called Hippopodes, aud oi others where the inhabi-
tants had no novering for their bodies but thor own ample ears
(Mela iii. § 563 Plin. iv. ἕ 953 Tac. G. 46, § 6).

With regard to the general character ol the country Caesar
does not tell ua much, because he does not know much. One
thing, as a practical man, be felt quite sure ol, namely, that the
soil of Germany was not to be compared with that os Gaul
(i 31, i 11: cp. 29, ξ 4)-εἰεο why the extreme readiness of
the Germana to change their locationi His picture of the

turning to the left, but it is rather the Danube which at this
point takes a shatp turn to the right, flowing lora time due
south, instead of east. The mention by Caesar (vi. 25, i a) ol
so obscure a people aa the Auartes stampe the passage as being
