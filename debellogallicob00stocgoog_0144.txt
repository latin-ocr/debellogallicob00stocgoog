and how in Britain in particular creta argentaria was dug up
from pits sunlr a hundred feet deep into the ground, and was
used for the same purpose. The effect, he says, lasted for
eighty years, and there was no instance of any one having
thrown it on hia land twice in a lifetime (N.H. xvii. ξς 42, 45)
Wrth regard to the political institutions of the Britons, we
,no have very little information. Diodorus Siculus speaks of their

being under iringa and potentates ¹. Caesar tallrs of linga, of
whom there were four in Kent alone (v. ης r), and of pn'n·
apes. Strabo speaks only of δυναστεῖαι. Tacitus, writing of
Agricola’s time, says that formerly the Britons obeyed linga,
but that then they were under premite: and torn by factione,
noticing the same inabiiity to combine which we have already
found to mark the Gauls. Dio Cassius at a atili later date says
of the Caledonii and Maestae that their government was mostly
democraticai Even in Caeaar's time the people counted for
something, so far at all events aa to serve as an excuse for
a measure which the chiese deslred to repudiate (iv. ry, ς 4).

a , As the Britons furnished aid to the Gauls against Caesar
(iii. 9, ξ ro ; iv. ao, ξ 1), it has been inserted that they must
have had ships like the Veneti: beyond this there is no evidence
for it. The only vessels that we hear of in connexion with thern
are the coracles, which were mere wicker-work covered with
leather. ln these, according to the historian Timaeus, who can
only be following Pytheas, they would take a aix days' voyage
to the island of Mictis, whence thetin came (Plin. N. H. iv.
§rofi vii. 5 206). These boats, says Pliny, ‘are made even
now in the British Oceant’

carried on hythe Veneti (iii. 8, ξ 1). Strabo (iv. 4, ξ ι) tells us
