practice is ‘that they may not huild too scientifically with a view
to avoiding extremes oi cold and heat' Strabo (viii. 1, § 3)
corroborates this account by saying, ‘A readiness to change
their abode is characteristic of all the people in these parts,
owing to the sinrplicity of their lile, and owing to their not

was at its maximum. He records, and may have himself
witnessed, the brilliant triumphos the last-named general, at

(iv. a, ξ 6). Posidonius, who wrote belore Caesar, speaks oi
