&aare legion (i. 7, 5 a; 8, 5 ι). He at once raised soldiers from the
’ΨΜ Province, levied two legions iu Cisalpine Gaul, and brought out
three from their winter-quartem at Aquileia (i. ro, 5 3).

The soldiers from the Province seem to have come under the
head of auxiliaries. Thus Caesar started at once with six
legions, though he had only been appointed to the command
of four. Of these six, four were composed of veternus and the
two levied in Cisalpine Gaul of tiros; to these latter was
assigned the care of the baggage during the battle with the
Helvetii (i wilh 3) Of the four weteran legions one was
the famous Tenth (i. 40, 5 ι5; 42, 5 5)

During the winter which followed the first campaign two new
leg‘ous were levied iu Cisalpine Gaul; iu the spring of nc. 57
these were sent into Further Gaul under the command of
Quintus Pedius (ii. a, 5 ι). Thus Caesar had eight legions
athis disposal when he commeneed operatione against the
Belgae. Sia of these were now seasoned veterans and bore
the brunt of the fighting in the battle of the Sambre fii. ao, 5 3),
while the two recent levIes were again assigned the charge of
thebaggagelii. 19, 53 3 26, 5 3). In the account of this battle
we get the names, or rather the numbers, of the six legions ·
engaged The IXth and Xth were victorious over the Atrebates
(ii. ag, 5 ι); the XIth and VIIIth drove back the Veromandui
(5 3); the Xllth and VIIth were roughly handled by the
Nervii (54). Thus we get a continuous series of legions—VII,
VIII, IX, X, XI, XII ; and, as Dio Cassius (xxxvfii, 47, 5 α)
informs us that Caesar's legions were numbered according
to the order of their enlistment, it follows that the two wluch
were not actively engaged were the XIIIth and Xthh. If we
conjecture that X was the legion which was in Gaul from
the first, it will follow that Vll, vm, and IX were the three
that were brought from Aquileia, and XI and XII the two first
levied in CIsalpine Gaul. Soon after the battle the VIIth legion
was despatched under Publius Crassus to the Armorican states
and spent the winter in AnJ'ou (ii. 3⁴3 iii. 7, 5 a). We hear of
