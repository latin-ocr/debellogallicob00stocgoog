or the Great St. Bernard. Finding the Transpadane territory
already fully occupied, they crossed the Padus in boats, and
expelled not only the Etruscans but also the Umbrians from
their homes. They did not, however, come south ol the Apen-
nines. Last os all the Senones arrived and established themselves
on the coast oi the Adriatic, from the river Utens on the north
to the Aesis, which bounded them from Picenum, on the south.

Such is Livy’s account of the passage ot' the Gauls into Italy
(v. 34, 35). It has been attacked of course-what is there that

waming, proceeding from so obscures source, was neglected,
insomuch that Camillus, the oue general oi the time, was allowed
to be sent into exile on some charge relating to the spoils
os Veii.

The Senones, who were the latest comers among the Gauls,
were induced sor some reason to attach Clusium ¹. That city
had held aloof from helping her sister Veii, and lor this merit
she now in her distress implored the aid os the Romans The
latter, instead os granting assistance, sent ambassadors to the
Gauls, to divert them, if possible, by peacelul means {rom their

Gaul when this event took place, but Livy gives ns no clue to the date oi ⁶
