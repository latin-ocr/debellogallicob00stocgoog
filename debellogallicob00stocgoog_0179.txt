to the possession of land, but only to the mode of cultivation.
Itis therefore, he maintains, as consistent with the idea of
private property as it is with that of communiam. And to
say that private property existed at this time among the
Germana he thinks is nearer to the truth marr to speak of
a system of communism. Only, the kind of private property

then in force must he carefully distinguished from that known
to us at the present day. It was a system of family proprietor-
ship which was in vogue among the Germana, with rights oi
property not vested in the soil, but in the family itself, so that
on changing the area of cultivation each family was entitled
to the same amount of land that it had occupied previously.
In support of this conclusion he cites the facts mentioned hy
Tacitus (G. ao, ξ 5) of heredity without testament and of males
only inheriting. He finds the German family at this early
period one and indivisible in the two main concems of life-
agriculture and war. Monsieur Fustel de Coulanges‚ as we
have seen, has not attempted to reconcile these views with
Caesar’s statements. But it might be said that a proprietor-
ship which was not confined to any given tract of soil might
well have appeared to Caesar to be no proprietorship at all,
and a system of annual¹ reassignment of land to be practically
indistinguishahle from its possession hythe state.

While Caesar‘s news on the land-question have been treated Gfl¹¹l⁸¹¹
with deferenoe in France, his statements about religion have mum·
been brusquely rejected in Germany. Jacob Grimm combats
with all the resources of his immense learning the opinion held
by some people that the earliest inhabitants of Germany ‘knew
nothing better than a gross worsh'p os nature wishem gods ¹.'
On the contrary, he declares that ‘in the first century of our
era the religion of the Germana tested mainly upon gods' At

¹ The only instance in which tt, de Conlauges' interpretation seems
to do any violence to the test of Tacitus is where (p. asarota 1) he makes
