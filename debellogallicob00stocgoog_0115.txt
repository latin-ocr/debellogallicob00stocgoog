They acted as a court oi public arbitration, and the mlost
important private suits, especially those ior murder, were
intrusted to their care (vi. 13, 5 5; Str. iv. 4, ξ 4). To enilorce
their decisions they possessed the dreaded power oi excommlsa'p
cation(vi.13,§ ). ,

The immortality of the seul, which to the Greeks andsseliesin
Romans was tie urum ot we philosopher, was viu ue oa ’,Ἥ
a part oi the popular creed. The Druids are credited witha
having taught this doctrine with the object oi making men '³
despise death in battle (vi. 14‚§5; Mela iii.§19; Lucani. x
460-2). But whether their motive was utility or speculative
conviction, they certainly succeeded in impressing the belief ⁸¹
upon the minds ol their countrymen‚ by whom it was held with ι
a startlingvividness. When some one died, people would take r
the opportunity ol posting letters to their friends who had gone
before3 if these were bumt along with the body os the deceased
on the pyre, the contents, it was imagined would pass with him
into the Kingdom ol Souls (D. S. v. 28, l 6). And when life
was over, the thought was still oi lite, so that men equipped their
relatives for a new existence by burning or burying with them
a stoclr of implements. Sometimes even the settlement os debts
was transferred to the alter-world, which was not considered
equivalent to apostponement stite dic (V al. Max. ii. 6,§ ro). Iflile
seemd intolerable when the lowed was lost, the pyre was there,
which would enable the mourner‚ not to die, but to live with him
(Mela iii 519). The only real measure os belief is what a man
is prepared to act upon. Apply this test, and we shall be forced
to admit that the beliel in a future lile was held in those dim
ages with a tenacity to which it has never since attained.

The precise form os the doctrine which was inculcated by the Mesem-
Druids was, we are told, metempsychosis (vi. 14, ξ 5; D. S. v. psychosis.
28, § 6). Herein their teaching resembled that oi Pythagoras,
but there is no evidence to show that they included in it
transmigration into animal forms.
