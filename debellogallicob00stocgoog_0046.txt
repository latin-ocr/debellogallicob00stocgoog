22 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

one and invited the other to dinner. Itis this side of his

character, so eloquently celebrated by Sallust, even more than

his magrdficent abilities, that has thrown such a charm and
glamur over the person of Caesar. Caesar could be swift and

terrible in retributiou, as when he kept his word to the pirates
and hanged them every one ς but he refused to cherish rancour
himself, and disarmed rancour in others. Even the men with
whose wives he was intriguing never seem to have borne him
malice. Cicero dishusted aud loved him; he exulted in his
death, and in the same breath pronounced his panegyric. And

In his childhood he had been a priest, ahiud of boy-bishop;
and his first great success in life was his being chosen Pontifex
Maximus, the Pope of the period, so far as there could be
a Pope in the years nc. Itis generally supposed that this
Sovereign Pontiff was a follower of the Epicurean philosophy
and a disbehever in Divine Provideuce. He certainly dwells
much in his own works on the power of fortune in war (see
iv. 26,§ 511), and ascribes the course of the world to that agency
in the speech which is put into his mouth by Sallust (Cat 51,
525). But all the same, he refers in quite an edifying way to
the finger of heaven as displayed in the chastisement of his
