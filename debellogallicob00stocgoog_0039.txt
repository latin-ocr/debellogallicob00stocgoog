THE coussmnmss 15

aelf had been found too severe ¹. Resides the vigour of thought
and expressim which stamps the speeches in Caesar, we may
admire the art with which he contrives to convey a favourahle
impression of himself and his actions through the medium
of the speakers, as when he makes Divitiacus (ii. 14, i 5) and
the Bellovaci (ii. 31, i 4) referto his well-known clemency,
when Labienus calls upon the soldiers to display the same

written.

'I'he conclusion just indicated would seem to point to some Manna or
revision of the work before publication. But on the whole ffif'oei‘
the Gallie War has the air of being written piecemeal and
shortly after the events recorded, which are viewcd through
the 'medinm of contemporary feeling. We can well believe
that the passage in which Caesar exults over the defeat of the
