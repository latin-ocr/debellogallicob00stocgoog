100 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

From this general sketch oi the character oi the Gauls we
must now advance to some more specific mention os the manners
and institutione in which that character revealed itself. These
relate to war and peace. To the student ol the Gallie War the
former naturally come first.

strength ol the Gauls lay chiefly in that department ¹. Their
nobility indeed are called by Caesar ‘equites' and they were
a nation of knights and squires. Caesar tells us oi the love that
the Gauls had for horses (iv. a, ξ a). We might judge oi their
successio this direction from the many Latin words connected
with riding and driving which are oi Celtic origin (iv. a, ξ a ni:
perhaps Epona herself was a Gallie goddess. The Senam,
aware oi the fondness of the Gauls ior horseflesh‚ when they
wished to conciliate their chiesa, sent them presents which

Cincibilis in 170 nc. (see p. 68) regarded it as a high privilege
to be allowed each to purchase ten horsea and transport them
from Italy to France. Diodorus (v. 29, ξ ι) describes the war·
chariots in use among the Gauls, which Lucan also (i. 42⁶)
attributes to the Belgae, but wc hear nothing about them irom
Caesar except in connexion with the Britons (iv. 33, § 1).

The weapons of the Gauls are described as very big-great
claymores and lances'. Their swords, says Diodorus (D. S. v.
30, ξ 4), are as large as other people’s spears‚ and their spear· ·
points as other people's swords. The claymore was attached
to their left sides by chains oi brass or iron (D. S. v. 30, ξ 5;

Str. iv. 4, ξ 3).
