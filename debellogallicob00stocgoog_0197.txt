Of what strength then, were the legions that served under
Caesar in Gaul? At first sight it seems natural to suppose that
their full number would be that ol the Marian legion. But
Plutarch evidently did not think thus. We know lrom Caesar
himself (Gi 7, 5 7) that he had only one legion with him
when he determined to march on Rome. Now Plutarch twice
tells us (Caes. 32: Pomp. 60) that he had not more at that time
than 5,ooo loot and 300 horse. Alter they had been long in
the field Caesar's legions, unless reiniorced, naturally lell lar
below this figure. Thus in the winter of ne 54, alter the
return irum the second expedition to Britain, we find Caesar

incidentally reclroning two legions (v. 48, 5 r) and about 4οο
cavalry (v. 46, 5 4) at 7,οοο men (v. 49, 5 7). This would give
us 3300 loot·soldiers for each legion. At Pharsalia the
effective strength ol the legion was reduced still lower, owing,
among other causes, to the serious losses at Dyrrhachium.

ol extreme attenuation that there were only gabo men apieoe
