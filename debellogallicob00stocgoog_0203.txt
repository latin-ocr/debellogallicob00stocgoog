Of all Caesar's legions the Tenth was the most famous, and TheTentn
this was the one in which he himself placed the greatest reliance. him·
This was the one which he said should serve as his body-guard
i‘praetoria cohors ’) if no one else followed him (i. 40 5153

this was the one which he found himself addressing when
‘he ran down, as chance offered, to encourage the soldiers,'

as the battle of Lake Regillus (nc. 498), its introductionis
