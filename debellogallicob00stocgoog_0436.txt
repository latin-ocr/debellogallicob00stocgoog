already harried some cattle of the Eburones. But they were not

gleefully seiaed the opportunity and rode up to the decuman gate
justat this moa awkward moment Tbere was a wild panis in
the camp, audit was with difficulty that the gates were held
against them. Fortunately for the Romans the hrave centurion,
Publius Sextius Baculus, bad been lett invalided in the garrison
Though so ill that he had been without food for five days, he
seired arms from the bystanders and took bis place at the gnte
He had soon to be carried off in n swoon, but his example was
followed by the other centurions of the cohort on duty, and the
men gained coniage to take their places on the works and present
au appearance of defence Meentime the five cohorte, vho had
now done their foraging, caught the souud of shonting in tbe
distance. Uuused to war they looked to their officers for directiom
but met with nothing but dismay and divided cnunsels, while the
enemy, perceiving their small numbers, promptly attacked them.

followed hythe camp-followers and cavalry3 but the recrmts, who
hesitated between defending themselves bya height and making
for the camp, were so severely handled by the enemy that two
cohorts were lost. The Germaus now thought fit to retire, but

arrived the same night they were not believed when they declared
that the army was safe On Caesar's own return he abstained
from reproach, complaining only of the cohorts having been allowed
to leave the camp, which it was their duty to protect.

After another expedition in search of Ambiorix, and a still more
searching devastatiou of his territories, Caesar led back his forces
to Reims (Durocortorum Remorum), where he convened the council
of Gaul, instituted an inquiry into the conspiracy among the
Senones aud Carnutes, and exacted vengeance from its author
Acco by a cruel and degrading form of execution After thisbe
settled his legions in winter-quartem and himself set out for

Cisalpine Gaul
