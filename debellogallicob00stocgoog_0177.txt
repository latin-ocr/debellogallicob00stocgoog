to the injudicious parsimony oi that monarch (Liv. xliv. 26).
Caesar displayed his appreciation ol the German cavalry in the Caesar's
most practical way, by having 400 of them in his service from ffnffies
a period which he describes as ‘ab initio' (vii. 13, § ι). When

he was hard pressed by the cavalry oi Vercingetorix, it was
across the Rhine that he looked for aid, importing from there

a body oi mixed cavalry and infantry. So much store 'did he

set by these allies, that he thought it worth while to dismount

his own officere, in order to supply the ridere with better horses

(vii 65,ss 4, 5). His German auxiliaries contributed largely to

his ultimate success (vii. 13,§ r; 67, § 53 70,ss a-7; 80, ξ 6).

to the last, but which Caesar has treated first, under the impres· gemmus

between the Germane and the Gauls. ‘Fon' says our author,
‘the Germans have no Druids ¹ to preside at divine worship, nor
do they attend to sacrifices. They recognise as gods only
those whom they see and by whose aid they are manifestly
assisted, namely, the Sun, Vulcan‚ and the Moon 3 the rest they
have not so much as heard of!

Such then is the picture that was drawn of the Germans the Geumi
first time they ever sat for their portrait. We see a people, ffith‘

from year to year, and liking to have plenty of elbon-roem in

engaged in constant war with one another; raising corn erops,
but without any study oi the finer methods of cultivation3
engaged still to a great extent in hunting; their habitations
mere temporary huts; their sole garments the trophies oi the
chase3 their main diet the produce of their own tloclrs and
