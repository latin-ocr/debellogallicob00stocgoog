selves vindicated the sanctity of this centralseatof Greek religion,
which could only he plundered by the Greeks themselves with
impunity. Apollo himself rushed into the fray with Artemis on
one hand and Pfflas on the other. The phantoms of heroes
too appeared in the light Even Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
who had sacked the temple in his life, defended it afier his
death Earthqualres, thunder and lightning, crashing araga,
cold snowy nights, and panic fears, which set the Gauls fighting

must turn to Livy.

they eventually reached Byzantium. Here the sight of the
Asiatic shore inspired them with the desire of pillaging a new
continent. They got possession by a triclr of the town of
Lysimachia, witich had been fotmded at the entrance to the
