the better to bear down all opposition. When there was special
need, the ‘turmae’ would be doubled by employing the cavalry of
two legions, as in nc. 180, when it became necessary to break
a ‘cuneus' ol Celtiberians ς in emergencies also they would take
the bits out ol the horses¹ mouths, so that there might be nothing
to stop the lory of the charge (Liv. xl. 40, 5 5). At no time,
however, were the Romans themselves particularly strong in
cavalry. Accordingly, while the infantry forces which they
horrowed from their allies were on an average equal to their
own, the cavalry were three times as numerous ¹.

The allies (‘socii') as a whole were commanded by twelve organiza- .
prefects (spaldenm‘ praelecti'), appointed by the consuls, and {iffifth‘
whom we gather from Livy to have been Roman citizens ¹. The
first care ol these officers was to select the very flower ol
the whole force, both horse and loot, for special service in
a body known as ‘extraordinarii ’ἶ About a third ol the cavalry
and a fifth part ol the infantry were thus told off. The rest

ol the allies were divided into two bodies known as the right

and lest wing (Polyb. vi 2555 5-9). Hence, the allied cavalry
were called ‘alarii equites’ to distinguish them lrom the
‘legionarii equites' (Liv. xl. 4ο). The iniantry ol the allles
were not enrolled into separate legions ol their own, nor did
they sorm part os the Roman legions. Their unit was the

cohort. Hence theywere lrnown as ‘cohortes alariae‘.' They
were distinguished {rom one another by local appellatione, such
as ‘cohors Lucana, Suessana, Peligna, Placentina ⁸! By Caesar's
