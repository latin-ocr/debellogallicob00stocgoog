liv. 2, ξ a), Strabo puts it at 3²0 stades or 40 Roman miles.
It is this passage which Strabo is really referring to when he
talks os the passage from the Rhine. He explains at last that
in stmung hom the neighbourhood of that river people did not
acmally sail from the mouth, but from the country of the
Morini, in which was Itium (iv. 5, 5 a, p. 199).

The statements of Diodorus Siculus on this subject cremore
correct and less confusiug than those os Strab0. The island,
he says, lies obliquely along the coast os Europe. It has three
promontories, Cantium, ‘where the sea makes its outflowss
Belenum (ie. the Land’s End) at the other extremity, and
a third, which runs out into the ocean and is called Oreas ¹.
The distance across the Straits ol Dover is understated by
Diodorus, who makes it only roo stades or 123 Roman miles;
but be says that Belenum is four days’ sail from the Continent

Mela (iii § 50) says that Britain lies to the north-west, that it
has a great comer facing the mouths os the Rhine, and that
men the sides go back obliquely, one of them looking towards
Gaul, the other towards Germany, and finally form two more
angles with the third side, so that the whole island is very like
Sicily. He tells us also that Europe is bounded on the north
hythe British Occan (ii 15), and that the Pyrenees run into
this ocean (ii. l 85). Pliny (ως 102) speaks to much the same
effect, but adds that Bn‘tain lies ‘opposite at a great distance,
to Germny, Gaul, Spain, and by iar the greatest parts ol
Europe? The term ‘British Ocean' is confined by Pliny
(iv. § 109) to the sea between the Scine and the Rhine,

That Diodorus Siculus and, to some extent, Strabo should
ignore Caesar's views is only part os the systematic neglectos
Roman writers hythe Greeks. One may read through some
of the Greek authors under the Empire without ever being
reminded that there was such a thing as Roman literature.
But it is more surprising that Pliny, in spite of Caesar’s precise
statement of the length os the passage from Gaul to Britain,
