8 C. IULII CAESARIS [1. 1-

contested battle, in which the success of the Romans was due
largely to the judicious action of young Publius Crassus, the
Germans ssed in the direction of the Rhine, which was fifty miles
from the place of battle. Many were cut down by the cavalry.
Ariovistus himself escapcd in a boat, but his two wives perished‚
and of two daughters, one was slain and the other taken prisoner.
Caesars emissaries were fortunately recovered.

The news of this victory deterred the Suebi from crossing the
Rhine, and they were followed when they turned homeward by the
Ubii, who cut down a good many of them. Caesar withdraw his
troops early into winter-quarters among the Sequani, where he
left Labienus in command3 he himself set out for Hither Gaul to
hold the assises

The geographical indications are too vague to allow us to fix
the site of the battle with Ariovistus The one definite state·
ment that we seem to have, namely‚ that the place was fifty
miles from the Rhine‚ is rendered uncertain by a difference in the
MSS„ some of which have ‘five’ Cernay, where Napoleon Ill
locates the battle, does not agree with either reading.
