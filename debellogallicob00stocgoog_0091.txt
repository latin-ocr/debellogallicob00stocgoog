They abrogated Caepio's command, passed a decree os exile
against him, and confiscated his property-a thing that had
not been done since the expulsion of Tarquin. Caepio died
miserably, hung two daughters behind him who supported
their lite by shameful means. After this the phrase ‘aurum
Tolosanum' passed into a proverb lor the ill-gotten gains that
never prosper (Liv. Epir. lxvii ; Sall. Jug. 1143 Str. iv. 1,§ 13;

in the consulship was the noble Q. Lutatius Catulus. He
waited in Cisalpine Gaul lor the Cimbri, who were to descend
upon Italy through Noricum, while Marius barred the way

enemy until his soldiers became well accustomed to the sight
ol them. Then the barbarians moved on, mockinglylasking
the Roman soldiers if they had any message to their wives.
