38 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

now be having a purely Celtic civiliaation in place oia Graeco-
Roman·Jewish one—that is, ii we were civilised at all.

The exiled Camillus, we are told, appeared on the scene in time
to save Rome from the last degradation oi paying her ransom
in gold. With the aid oi the menos Ardea and oi the Romans
who had fied to Veii, he defeated the Gauls amid the ruins oi
the city, and on the following day, eight miles off, on the road
to Gabii. But their numbers had already been decimated by
disease contracted during their long stay under the burning sun
oi Rome amid the stilling ashes ol a ruined city. They had got
tired oi burying their dead singly, and had come at last to
heaping them together in what was afterwards known as the
Busta Gallica (Lis. v. 48, §3² xxii. 14, §uh First impres-
sions count sor much; and this rude experience which the
Romans had oi the Gauls inspired them with an enduring terror
of these formidable adversaries, who, with their glant limbs and
huge weapons, seemed created ior the destruction ol men and
the devastation ol cities (Flor. i. 7, 5 4). The word ‘tumultus'
which was especially used os danger irorn the Gauls, is explained
by Cicero (Phil viii. i 33 cp. Serv. on Verg. Aen. viii. ι) to be
a contractiori from ‘timor multus! The derivation is no more
successful than those ol the Ancients generally, but it serves to
illustrate our point. When a ‘mmulurs' was proclaimed‚ no
exemptione lronr service were allowed to hold good ¹, but all
who wished their country to be saie were bound to follow their
general. This proclamation was only made in the case ol an
Italian or Gallie loe.

Alter the disappearance os the Senones, Rome had rest from
the Gauls sor twenty-three years: but in 367 a. c. they appeared
again, and Camillus was appointed to his filth dictatorship to
cope with them. Thisbe did successfully, aud the enemy were
dispersed into Apulia. The veteran general triumphed at the
age os eighty, and died two year's later (Liv. vi. 42: vii. 1, i 83
App. iv. ι).
