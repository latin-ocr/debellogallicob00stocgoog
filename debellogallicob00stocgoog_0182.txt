178 CAESAR'S 6ch tm

Joeephna the short account given by Josephus in his Jewish War¹ oi
those Roman armies, against which he had himself contended.
In his pages we seem to hear the tramp oi the legions as they
pursue their march, inexhaustible in resources, irresistihle in
might, and can still leel the shiver which their approach sent
through the hearts ol the brave but undisciplined ‘barbaricus'

wrote in a time ol degeneracy and defeat with a view to
restoring the old Roman training and in particular the use oi
delensire mmour, the discontinuance oi which Gibbon declares
to hare been ‘the immediate cause oi the downlall ol the
empire' Vegetius mentions as his authorities Cato the Censor,
Cornelius Celsus, Frontinus, and Paternus, together with the
‘constitutions' ol Augustus, Trajan, and Hadrian: but the use
which he makes ol these materials is so uncritical that we never
know ol what period he is spealdng. Cato died in rac. 149.
His work De Re Militari is quoted also by Aulus Gellius
(vi. 4, 5 5). Cornelius Celsus (about run. 50) is better known
to us as the Latin writer on medicine: but his was an en·
cyclopaedic genius, which embraced all subjecta, though Quin·
tilian (xii. rr, ξ 24) pronounces him to have been a man ol
only moderate ability. Julius Frontinus was succeeded by
Agricola in the command ol Britain in the year ran. 78. He
is called ‘a great man' by Tacitus (Agr. 17), and he had
shown his practical acquaintance with the art ol which he wrote
hythe subjugation ol the Silures, the most powerful tribe in
South Walcs. He took part also in putting down the revolt

oi Julius Civilis, and received the surrender oi the Lingones
(Front iv. 3, ξ 14). The work of his which has come down to
us under the name ol ⁴ Strategematon' is not his treatise on the
art ol war, which has unfortunately perished, but a series oi

aueodotes aiter the manner of Valerius Maximus, only shorter
and more scrappy, intended to equip the general with examples
