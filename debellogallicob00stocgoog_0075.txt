WARS WITH THE GA ULS 55

In zor ac. peace was at last concluded with the Carthaginiane. close os
The Romans were now free to settle accounts with the Gauls ffiffiuss
and Liguriam at their leisure. The settlement was a very
lengthy process indeed. but it was pursued by the Romans with
that pertinacity in which their chief strength lay.

With the Ligurians we are not concerned, except in so far as Operations
they made common cause with the Cisalpine Gauls.‘ They mg?
were a race of hardy mountaineers, but their strength in regular
warfare was not great, and the difficulty was not so much to
conquer as to catch them. Operations against them dribbled on
stom year to year until 190, when the proconsul Q. Minucius
reported that the country was entirely subdned (Liv. xxxvii. 2).
Minucius however was refused a triumph, and the sequel
justified the Senate's estimate of his performances. For the
very next year a praetor, L. Baebius, passing through the
country to his province of Spain, was attached by the Ligurians
and his retinue slain or put to flight. He himself escaped to
Massilia, where he died within three days from the wounds that
he had received (Liv. xxxvii. 57). Two years later (mc. 187),
there being no more important campaign on hand, we find both
consuls carrying on war in Liguria, which served the Romans
as a naming-ground to keep up their military discipline in
periods when it might otherwise have lapsed ¹. The Ligurian
triba were again entirely subdued this year, and the consul
Q. Marcius badly defeated by them the next. After this for
seven years running (Β. c. 185-179) both consuls were employed
in Liguria. The Romans at last adopted a Persian policy, and
removed the Apuani Ligures, a specially troublesome tribe, to
some public lands in Samnium, while they compelled others of
the Ligurians to descend from the mountains to the plains.

Two years later the consul C. Claudius, having conqueret] [ln-
Istrians, transferred his army into Liguria and won a victory

intervalla bellorum Romanis militarem disciplinam erat!
