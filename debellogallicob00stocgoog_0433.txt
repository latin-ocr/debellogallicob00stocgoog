DE BELLO GALLICO. LIB. VI 203

say where, bnt we may assume that it was at his headquarters of
Samarobriva-and, finding that the Senones, Carnutes, and Treveri
did not attend, considered this to be equivalent to a declaration of
war. He therefore broke up the conacil and ordered it to meet
again at Paris, which was a convenient point for operating against
the Senones (Sens). The rapidity of his movements induced both
this tribe and their neighbours the Carnutes (chartres) to sue for
mercy through the Aedui and Remi. Caesar, anxious not to be
detained, granted it for the time. Then he held the couneil and
ordered cavalry from the states.

Caesar was now free to devote his attention entirely to the
scheme of vengeance he meditated. There was uo chance of
Ambiorix maeting him in the field: the question was how to catch
him. The country to the west of his was in Caesar’s hands, bnt
he might escape northwards into the territory of the Menapii,
a land of woods and marshes, whose inhabitants had never sent
ambassadors to Caesar, or eastwards to the Germana amors the
Rhine, with whom the fugitive chieftain had entered into friendly
relations through the Treveri. Both these contingencies had to be
guarded against. For operatione in these directions Arniens was
no longer suitable as a base. Caesar therefore transferred the
baggage of the whole army to the camp of labienus ’in or near
,the country ofthe Treveri (cp. v. 24, ς a; 53,§ 1: vi. 5, l 63
Μ 1), sending with it two legions. He himself with five lightly
equipped legions marched against the Menapii, and, having entered
their country in three divisione, made such havoc of it as to cause
them to ask for terras, which were granted on the express condition
that they would not harbour Ambiorix
’ Meanwhile labienus had been as energetic and successful as
Caesar. ΤΙιο Treveri had been on the point of attacking his single
legion with large forces both of horse and foot, when they learnt
that it had been reinforced by two others. This news made thern
at first desirous of waiting for the Gennans, whose aid they were
expecting. But the wily lientenant was able, as usual, by working
upon their seli-confidente, to draw them into a disastrous engage-
ment, which was followed by the surrender of the state, so that
when their allies arrived, there was nothing for them to do but to
go home again. The kinemen of Indutiomarus went with them,
aod the govemrnent was handed over to Cingetorix.
