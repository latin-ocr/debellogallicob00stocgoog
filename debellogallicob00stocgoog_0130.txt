and Isidorus made the circumference of the island to be 4‚875
miles (N. H. iv. 102).

If a line be drawn from point to point along our coasts
without following the indentations, the south is found to give
330 English miles ¹, the east 596, the west 668, and the north
74, which gives a total of 1,668 miles for the circumference.

Caesar, regarding the island as a triangle, recognises awest
coast, which he puts at 700 miles: but what we regard as the
east coast was to him the north coast, with the exception of
the corner which ‘looks towards Germany’ (v. 13, 6 6). This
north coast he says is considered to be 800 miles long. lfan
island has three sides, of which one faces north and the other
west, it follows that the third must run from the north to the
west, aud this was apparently Caesar’s opinion with regard to
the trend of the coast from Keot to the Land’s End. He does
not say that the whole of the side which was opposite Gaul
looked south, but only the lower corner of Kentlv.13,§1).
This third side he reckons at about 500 miles, which brings
the circumference of the island up to a,ooo miles, an estimate
which is less than the truth, if we follow all the bendings of
the coast, but more than what is got by measuring from one
prominent point to another.

Although Diodorus Siculus wrote after Caesar, he seems to
have preferred the authority of the Greek mathematician to that
of the Roman general. As his statement of the length of
Britain coincides with that of Pytheas, it seems fair to infer that
his other measurements are derived from the same source.
According to him the shortest side, which stretches along
Europe, is 7,5oo stades, the side which reaches from the strait
to the apex of the triangle 15‚ooo‚ and the third side ao,ooo, so
that the whole circumference amounts to 42,5oo stades, or
5312} Roman miles. This accords with what Strabo says as

to Pytheas making the circumference ‘more than 4o,ooo stades,’
