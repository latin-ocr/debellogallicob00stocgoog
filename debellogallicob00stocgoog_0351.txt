DE BELLO GALLIOO. LIB. IV 123

sible reasons for this step. One was that the cavalry of the
Usipetes and Tencteri, after hearing of the destruction oi their
people, had crossed into the territory of the Sugambri, who now
refused to surrender them at Caesare order3 the other was that
the Ubii were imploring his protection against the Suebi. The
Ubii offered ships to transport the army, but Caesar considered
that it would be at once safer and more impressive to eroes by
a bridge. The work was finished in ten days from the time when ’
the timber began to be felled Thus did Rome first 'set foot upon

Caesar was, had hitherto stubbornly defied him3 some maintained
their independence even now, but the greater part made offers of
submission. Two legions, the seventh and tenth, were selected for
the expedition into Britain. The rest were left under the command
of Sabinus and Cotta to be led against the Menapii and those
