Germana and, notwithstanding the apparent strength of Trajan's
empire, the historian in a prophetie moment declares that it was
only the discord of their enemies that secured the Romans from
destruction. The question has been raised whether Tacitus
himself had any direct acquaintance with Germany. We may
fairly suspect that at all events the account of tlre alternation
between Flavius and liminius (A. i. 9, ro) was not based on
a personal observation of the German rivers.

Mela (iii. ξς 24, 29) speaks of great lakes in Germany. Laken
Besides Plevo¹ he mentions Suesia, Metia, and Melsyagum.
Tacitus (G. Μ r: cp. A. 60, ξ 3) is more explicit in talking
of lakes among the Frisii, though he does not give names to
them. We know that great changes took place in this respect
in the thirteenth century, when what had before been separate
lakes became merged in the Zuyder Zee.

A country which was covered with such dense growths of Veffetable
timber was naturally not rich in vegetable products of any other “ssodffll
description. Tacitus speaks of the soil as good for cereals,p
which were all that its cultivators demanded from it (G. 5, i r;
26, ξ a). Pliny (xviii. ᾗ 149) talks of the tribes of Germany
sowing wild oats (in no metaphorica} sense), and declares
roundly that this was their only vegetable diet Mela (iii. ξ 56)
however reserves this statement for the Oeonae, whom he
describes as dwelling on tidal islands in the Baldo, and eking
out their subsistence with birds' egga When we are told by
a Roman that the country was bad for fruit-trees⁹, we have to
think principally of the olive, and of the vine, which did not
then cover the sunny hills of the Rhine. It was noticed that
the plains of Upper Germany were covered with a kind of wild
asparagus, which grew so thick that the Emperor Tiberius
remarked, in what was considered to be a witticism, that the
grass there was very like asparagus (Plin. xix. ξ 145). The
same emperor made the skirwort of Germany famous by
