200 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

as much again (‘ sesquiplex stipendium ') as that ol the common
soldier, and Polybius (vi. 39, 5 rs) tells us that the Roman
knight received triple pay, which would be double that os the
praetorias cohort This gives point to the remark of the wag
in the tenth legion, who declared that Caesar, iu mounting it,
was doing more than he promised (i. 42, 5 6). Caesar does
not seem to have had a regular praetorian cohort at all, hut
it was quite a usual thing atthis period. Petreius, acting as
‘legatus' to C. Antonius, had one in the engagement with
Catiline (Sall. Cat. ⁶0, 5 5); afterwards, when he fought against
Caesar in Spain, he had one on his own account (C. i. 75, 5 a).
Each member of the second triumvirate, Octavian, Marii Antony,
and Lepidus, had his special praetorian cohort (App. Civ. iv. 7);
so had Silanus and Hirtius (Cic. Fam x.30,§1); so even had
Cicero in his warlike exploits in -cilicia (Fam. xv. 4, 5 y). This
was the germ out of which were developed the Praetorians or
household troops at Rome under the Empire. ’
The cohors The normal cohorte iu Caesar's army seem so lar as we can
proper. gathcr, to have been oi unilorm strength

It is one ol the anomalies oi the Roman army that the
cohort, notwithstanding its importanoe aiter the reforms ol
Marius, never meme to have had a definite offieer oi its
own¹.

lt was not so with the maniple, which at all times had its
proper officer in the centurion. Hence the juxtaposition oi
‘centurio' and ‘manipulares sui¹.' In the pre-Marian army
each oi the three divisiuns, ‘hastath' ‘principes' and ‘triarii'
was divided into ten parts, thus giving the thirty maniples which
made up the legion, exclusive of the ⁸ velites' assigned to each
(Polyb. vi. 24, 5 3). The cohort is supposed to have consisted
oi a maniple from each division.

Emperor.
