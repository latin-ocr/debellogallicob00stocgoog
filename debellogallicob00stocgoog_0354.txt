126 C wan CAESARIS

Mariette Bey, hy Mr. 'lhomas Lewin, hythe two Napoleons, and
by M. Desjardins.

Caesar does not distinctly say that the place from which he
started was the same in both expeditions, hut his narrative
certainly implico it. From his silence as to the name of the
harbour in his account of the first expedition, we may conjecture
that he had not then learnt it The name Portus Itius may have
been given to the place hythe Romans themselves during their
second stay there in 54. There is a small village called laques
on the left bank of the hinne, which the sea is said to have reached
in former times, and which some have thought may have given its
nemeto theharbour. Gesoriacum is of later date than Caesar,
hut it sprang rapidly into importante, so that Mela (iii. 5 ²3)
speaks of it as the most noted place on all the north coast of Gaul

lf the Portus Itius be Boulogne, then the ‘ulterior' or ‘superior
portus’ (ης 1; 28, ὁ 1) may be safely identified as Amhleteuse‚
which would be eight miles off for the cavalry, who would have
to follow the vindingo of the hills.

Another point that may be considered highly probahle is that it
was under the cliffs of Dover that Caesar lay to with his men of
war waiting for the arrival of the transporta. But after this we are
involved in uncertainty. The crucial point is this—When Caesar
got the tide as wellas the wind in his favour, at the ninth honr of
the day, and movecl on seven miles (23, i 6), did that tide carry
him up or down the-Channell According to Mr. lewin it carried
him down, and he landed at Romney Marsh, which was so called
from this fact; according to Napoleon Ill it carried him up, and
he lauded at Deal Attempts have been made to settle this point
hythe aid of astronomy, and it might conceivably be so settled, for
the horologe of heaven inexact in its working, if only we were
eure of the day. The mouth, itis assumed, was August, for the
summer had nearly run out (20, i 1), but Caesar found the harvest
still in the fields (31, § a).

Now on the night which followed the fourth day (rechoning
inclusively) from Caesar's landing there was a full moon (28, § 13
29,§ 1). But it is known that in uc 55 the moon was full at

3 aar. in the morning of Thursday, Aug. 31. Therefore the day
on which Caesare cavalry were swept away hy a storm from before
his eyes was Wednesday, Aug. 30. This is the day of which
