160 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR ’

insisting on having it brought to him every year from that
country. We may suppose that he had learnt to appreciata it
during his campaigns. The finest was considered to grow near
a fortress called Gelduba on the Rhine (Piin. xix. 5 90).

The height oi trees is no evidence of a rich soil, for one may
see the most gig-antio plne-tree growing out oi what looks like
bare rock ; neither, says Pliny (xvii 5 26), is an abundance of
grass ‘For what more famous than the pastures of Germany?
And yet you have only to scratch the soil to come on the sand
beneath.’ The cattle however, though numerous, were poor
and stunted (Tac. G. 5, 5 a), which is not the case at the
present day. Caesar himself (iv. a, § a) dwells upon the small·
ness of the horses among me Suebi. But if the tame animais
were small, this was made up for by the siae of the wild ones,
the urr‘ reported by Caesar (vi. 28, § ι) as standing a little lower
than elephanta, and the maned bisons mentioned by Pliny
(N. H. viii. 5 38) There were fish too of a prodigious size to
be found in the rivers. In the Main in particular the silurus
was reported to attain to such a siae that it could drown horses
swimming, and required to be hauled out bys team of oxen
(N. H. ix. 5 45). The geese of Germany, witich Pliny (N. H.
x. 5 53) tells us were called gantae, were small, and there·

pdtl desoie gras, but the down of me white ones was considered
especially good, and fetched as much as five denarri'a pound.
The thrushes or fieldfares (turdi), which disappeared from Italy
in the winter, were to be seen in Germany at that season.

We come now to ibe human inhabitants of the country.

We at the present day have a notion of a clearly marked
distinction between Gaul and German—a distinction which we
suppose not to become obliterated until our thoughts remount
to the original home of the Aryan tace, if there ever was such
ahappy family. This distinctionis based on language. Now
language was just the thing which the Ancients never attended

to, since the Greeks and Romans unfortunately took the view
