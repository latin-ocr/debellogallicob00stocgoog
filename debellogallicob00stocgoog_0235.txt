DE BELLO GALLICO. LIB. 1 5

pursuers instead oi pursued, thinking perhaps that Caesar's
movements were dictated by iear. They ventured to attack the
Romans when they were drawn up on rising ground. Α long and
desperate battle ensued, which ended in the complete defeat of the
Helvetii and their allies. About 13o,0oo rnen who escaped from
the field mardred night and day for three days until they reached
the territory ot the Lingones (Langres). Caesar was occupied
during this time with the care ol the wounded and the butial of
the dead, buthe sent despatches to the Lingones not to assist the
fugitives When he started in pursuit oi them again they all
surrendered unconditionally‚ except 6,οοο, who tried to escape
by night, but who were brought back and slaughtered in cold
blood .

Why, it may be asked, were the Helvetii heading northwards, it
their object was to reach the country oi the Santoni? The answer
to this question is to be found in the fact that the mountains which
lie between the Sadne and the Loire rendered their march due
west a practica] impossibility. The Emperor N apoleon has pointed
out that in the old coaching days the way from Lyon to I.a
Rochelle was first northward to Autun and then westward to
Nevers. As regards the point at which the Helvetii crossed the
Sadne and the locality os the battle-field, Caesar has not afforded
us sufficient data from which to determine thern We must be
content to know that the battle took place within a radius ot
eighteen miles from Bibracte, at a place which is now generally
admitted to be Mont Beuvray.

Alter the submission os the Helvetii and their allies Caesar
restored them to their country, preferring them as neighbours to
the Germans who were pretty certain to step into their place. The
Boii however at the request oi the Aedui were settled in the corner
of the Aeduan territory which lies between the Loire and the
Allien, near the junction os those rivers.

By turning back the invasion oi the Helvetii Caesar had un-
doubtedlydone a service to Gaul, and the Gauls showed themselves
sensible oi the lact3 they exhibited that gratitude which has been
defined as a lively expectation oi favours to come. 1t Caesar had
disposed ol the Helvetii, might be not rid them also oi Ariouistus
and his Germane? Accordingly they requested that a general
council oi Gaul might be held with Caesar's special sanction. ‘ibis
