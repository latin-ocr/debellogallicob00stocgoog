disgusting to the Romans. Mela (iii. § εδ) says that ‘they
would eat their meat raw, either when it was fresh or aller it
had been allowed to freeze in the hides oi the cattle or wild
hmsts, and had then been lreshened up by kneading it with the
hands or stamping it with the leet' Even now the eating of
raw flesh has not altogether disappeared from among the
Germana and Swedes. But iisomething was lacking in this
respect in the manners of the Germans, it was atoned for by
their extreme hospitality, which Caesar (vi. a 3, ξ 9) describes as
having the weight with them oi a religious obligation‚ and ol
which Tacitus (G. ar) has drawn so charming a picture. Mela
(iiii 28) also mentions it In this matter they had quite an
opposite reputation to that ol the ‘Britannos hospitibus feros! '
Caesar (iv. r, ξ ιο; vi ar, ξ 5) represents the clothing ol the elothing.
Germana as extremely primitive, consisting only ol skins and
the scanty upper garments known as ‘rhenones ¹.’ Mela (iiii πό)
says that the men ‘wear saga or the bark oi trees, no matter
how severe the winter! The ‘sagium' wasawoollen mantle, and
implies a knowledge of spinning or wearing. Pliny speaks ol

the wearing of flax as pretty general among the Gauls in his
day and already practised by ‘the enemy across the Rhine,'
whose women knew no finer dress than one of linen ². He
adds that the work was carried on in holes dug out beneath the
ground, whereby we are reminded ol what Tacitus (G. 16, ξ 4)
says oi the subtenanean storehouses for grain among the
Germans. The same author (G. 17, § 3) corroborates Pliny by

¹ Servius. commenting on Verg. Geor. iii. 383 ‘Et pecudum iulrls relatur
corpora κεῦθ’ explains thelast word by‘ renonibus’ (the hisosten omitted),
adding ‘Nam ut Sallustius dicit ln historiis: “Vestes de pellibus renones
vocantur.'’' Cp. the fragment ol Sallust (assigned by Curtius to the sixth
book ol the Historias) which is quoted by isodorus ‘Germani intectum
renonibus corpus tegunt! Varro (1, L v. s 167) says that ‘mgum' aad
