both armies (viii. 54,ss a, 3, compared with C. iii ΒΜ ri
About this however it will be necessary to spesh more
particularly later on.

The number of the legions has now mounted to ten, oi which

in the winter os 53·² nc. two were located in the country
oi the Treviri, two in that oi the Lingones, and the remaining
six at Agedincum (vi Μ 3). Their numbers were 1, VII,
VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV.

In the spring of nc. 52 Caesar brought a relnforcement
(‘ supplementum 'i with him from Italy (vii. 7, ξ 5), which we
find ailerwards left in charge of Labienus' baggage at Agedincum
(ΒΜ r). The ten legions already in the field were divided
between Caesar and Labienus in the proportion of six to the
commander and four to the lieutenant (vii. 34, ξ a). We know
that VII and XII were with Labienus (vii. 62, ξ 3), and that he
had one legion oi raw recruits, whom he did not trust ior
fightIng (60,§ a). The two tiro legions were now XIV and
XV. Caesar is hardly likely to have given both these to
Labienus3 hence we may reasonably infer that one was with
Labienus and the other with Caesar. With Caesar also were

that we have only one oi Labienus' legions and two of Caesar's

left unaocounted ior. The 700 men lost at Gergovia (vii. 51,
§ 4) seem to have belonged mainly to the VIIIth legi0n (vit 47,
§73 50, l 4)·

So far it appears clear that Caesar had only ten legi0ns and
a reini0rcement, which was probably Intended to be draIted
oh* into the existIng legions to repair their Iosses. The account
of winter-quartem at tbe end os Caesar's Seventh Book seems
toconfirm this view; for the location os nine legions is specifically
given, aiter thch we haue the addition-‘ he himself determined
to wihter at Bibracte! Now Hirtius (viii. a, § r) tells us that
Caesar, when be made his winter eally against the Bituriges,
