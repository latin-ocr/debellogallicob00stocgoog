BRITAIN 121

northward ol Britain, and near the Frozen Sea’ (Str. p. ⁶3
ad init.; cp.Plin.N. H.iv.s 104). ln this region, as we are
informed by Pliny (N. H. ii.§ 187), Pytheas recorded that the
days and nights were six months long. Here, too, our mariner
declared that ‘the world came to an end in a substance that
was neither sea nor land nor air, but a compound ol these,
like a J‘elly·tish, in which earth and sea and all things hung
suspended, and that this served as a kind ol hond-ol the
universe, through which one could neither walk nor sail.' This
remarkable statement is expressly made on hearsay by Pytheas.
All that he depones to himself is having seen the jelly-lish
appearance ¹. Perhaps he had only seen a good sea-sog.

Notwithstanding his denunciation ol Pytheas Strabo admits
the accuracy ol his astronomical and mathematical views with
regard to the countries hordering on the lrozen zone, and
quotes without dissent bis observations on the paucity ol
vegetable and animal lile, as one advanced northward, the
sustentation os life on coarse cereale, herries, and roots, the
manufacture ol mead from com and honey, where these were
to be had, and the use ol large barns in place ol threshing
floors, which were rendered useless owing to the rain and
the absence ol sunshine (iv. 5, 55, p. ποι). Other eminent
writers in antiquity accorded a lar less grudging acceptance to '
the statements ol Pytheas. Eratosthenes had some doubts as
to the extent os his travels, which might well be inspired by
the mention oi the Tanais, buthe accepted him as an authority
on Britain and Spain; Hipparchus is repeatedly censured by
Strabo lor his belief in him3 Pliny nowhere questions his
veracity and names him as an authority lor three ol his books.
ln more modern times his reputation has been warmly defended
hy his great countryman Gassendi.

The only mention ol the British Isles that occurs in an extant Polybius.

Greek author prior to the time of Caesar is in Polybius (iii. 57).
