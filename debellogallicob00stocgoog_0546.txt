terme in which he was spoken of at table 1 came to the conclusion
that l must by all means make bis acquaintance Accordingly,
not trusting myselfin Freucb beyond viva voce,1 indied a Latin
epistle, which an obligiug waiter undertook to deliver at M. Bulliot’s
residence the first thing next morning. The letter however was
returned to me with the disappointing intelligence that M. Bulliot
was away and was not expected backfora weelc

lt used to be thought that Autun (the ‘Augustodunum' of Tac.
Ann. iii. 43) was itself the Bibracte of Caesar. But we had to do
twenty kilometree of very uphill work befme we got to St. beger
sous Beuvray, and then five kilometres more of a still steeper
hillside before we began the actual ascent of the mountain. By
this time the bind wheel of my bicycle had sbed most of its
spokes and my companion perceived it to be bending like an S as
l mounted¹, so that, with the fatherly care which he took of me
in this respect, he judged it best to ride it for the rest of the day
himself, thus giving it somewhat less to carry. Leaving our
machines hidden under the bracken in a wood we followed a path
which was plausible at first, but eventuallybrought us into a mornas,
and afterwards into a dense jungle of nettles and brambles Alter
this things began to improve alittle, but the summit seemed un·
attainable and to be blocked by wood, ifwe attained it We were
just sitting down to have our lunch when my companion discovered
that a most forbidding hedge, which apparently only separated one
part of tbe mountain-side from another, really concealed a deep
lane below it. Down into this lane went the satchel containing
our luncheon. After this we came; and the lane brought us in
due course to the plateau at the real summit Here we met an old
man who dropped unsolicited tbe remark that M. Bulliot was in the
cottage which we had just passed. Here was a reward for per·
severance l 1 wrote him an abbreviated version of the Latin letter
on the back of my card, which was taken in to him by the old man
We went on to the edge of the plateau and enjoyed a glorious
panorama from a spot where there stands a monument com-
memorating the passage of St. Martin, the apostle of the Galus,
