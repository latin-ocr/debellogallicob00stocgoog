212 CAESAR‘S GALLIC WAtt

tinus was now among the upper centurions, and fairly advanced
among them. Once more he volunteered lor service against
the Aetoliam and King Antiochus, against whom war was
declared in sc. ¹91· This time he was promoted by the
consui Acilius to the command of the ‘ primus princeps prioris
centuriae! After the expulsion ol King Antiochus and the
subjugetion oi the Aetolians the army was shipped back to
Italy, where he served lor two years. Alter this he fought
twice in Spain, once under Q. Fulvius Flaccus and again under
Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the father ol the famous tribunes,
who was praetor in Spain in nc. 181. No sooner had he been
brought home by Flaccus to share his triumph than he started
ior Spain again at the nequest oi Gracchus. Four times within
slew years he was leader ol the ‘primus pilns'3 he received
rewards for gallantry thirty-four times from his commendem
and was presented with six crowns lor saving the tite ola
sellun-countryman. The last thing we know oi him is that
he was appointed, when over fifty, to the command oi the
‘primus pilus' in the first legion which was to serve against
Perseus in nc. 171 (Liv. xlii. 34, 35).

Tbis digression hus not been irrelevant; for, though the
distinction between ‘hastati' ‘principes' and ‘triarii' or ‘piloni'
was swept away when the army was remedelled by Marius,
yet the centurions even in Caesar's time retained the titles
which had a meaning only under the old system. Thus P.
Sextius Baculus, the leading centuriones the twelfth legion, is
called by Caesar (iii. 5, 5 a) ‘primi pili centurio,' and by a
convenient, but illogical abbreviation, ‘primipilus’ (ii. agi 1)¹.
