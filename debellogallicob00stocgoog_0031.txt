not seem to have given to the world. Louls Philippe had
a map made to illustrate Caesar's Campalgns in Gaul. Lastly
the two Napoleons made the Commentaries the object ol
their special care. Napoleon I, at St. Helena, dictated
a ‘Precls des Guerres de Cesar' to Comte Marchand, and
his nephew, Napoleon 111, applied all the resources of his
power and of an acute lntellect to the elucidation ol this single
