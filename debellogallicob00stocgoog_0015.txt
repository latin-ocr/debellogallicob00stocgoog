PREFACE ix

has done me a similar service with respect to Kampenâ€™s
maps and plans.

1 might go on to mention the kindness that hasbeen
shown to me by French scholare, were I vain enough to
think that this utteranee would be heard across the
Charmei. But l cannot sorbeat to mention the name oi
Monsieur Max Bonnet, Professor oi Latin at Montpellier,
who leit nothing undone to render my visit to France
as instmetive as it was delightiul.

I have had before to make acknowledgements to
Mr. C. S. Jerram for his kindness in correcting proois
ior me. 1t is no slight testimony oi friendship that he
has revised every proof from the beginning of the work
to the end. To come nearer home still, 1 arn indebted
to my wife ior the arrangement oi the grammatica! index.
Here it might seem natural to stop, did not justice
suggest that there isone acknowledgement which has
been omitted, and that is to the Reader at the Clarendon

Press, a person-ii he be indeed a person, and not
a principle oi exactitude-oi concealed identity, but
oi manifest attainments.
