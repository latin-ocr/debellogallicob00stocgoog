92 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

the subject, but after it or at the end of the sentence. The
great quarry for the student is the proper names of persons
aud places, whether preserved in ancient authors or in inscrip-
tions, even the hrands on pottery are hunted up with eagerness
that something may be gleaned from them. But as Rome
imposed her laws and institutions upon the barbarians, so also
did she mould their names into confonnity with her own tongue.
The result in the case of the Gauls is to give us a stateliness
of nomenclature surpassing that of the Romans themselves.
Vercingetorix, Vercassivellaunus, Andecumborius‚ and ether
polysyllabic heroes might perhaps present a more homely
appearance if we had them strictly in their native dress. This
latinization of Gallie names seems in one case to have led the
philologists astray. Thus it has been argued from the occur·
rence of forms lile Biturigas that the Gallie accusative of stem
rag· was rigas. But it was the fashion among Roman writers
—a lashion dictated by obvious convenience-to avail themselves
of the Greek accusative itt -os in the case of proper names of
the third declension. From Greelr names this fashion spread to
foreign names generally, and is quite sufficient to account for
the forms on which the theory of the Gallie accusative is based.
The trihal and personal names of the Gauls lend themselves to
the purpose of the philologist lor the reason that they are not
non-connotative, but are componnded of significant elements,
the meaning of which may he made out bya comparison with
the still hving members of the Celtic family of languages or
those in which written documenta are extant. They generally
refer to provess in battle, and turn out on interpretation to be as
lofty in meaning as they are phonetieally high-munding. Thus
the element cotu- means ‘battle' and rix ‘king’ so that
Caturiges means ‘battlekings'3 Catuvolcus means ‘swift in

battle'; Catugnatus ‘experienced in battle' or ‘known in
battle! Cingetorix again means ‘king of warriors,’ and Ver·
cingetorix exalts this further hy a preposition equivalent to ὑπέρ
and naper- Amhiorix is interpreted to mean ‘king of the
