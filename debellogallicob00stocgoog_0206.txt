Μ CAESAR'S cattle WAR

was ignominiously put to ssight by 800 German horsemenl
(iv. ra, 5 r)-a striking illustration of Caesar's own remark thgt

the hare-backed German riders thought themselvesa match f r
any number of cavalry who were effeminate enough to use
housings (iv. a, 5 5). at the time of the second invasion of
Britain Caesar's cavalryis again down to 4‚ooo (v. 5, 5 3;
8, 55 1, a), though thiais called ‘the cavalry of the whole
of Gaul:

The Gallie cavalry, at least such part of it as was permanently
attached to Cacsar's army, seems to have been organized in
Roman fashion. It was divided into ‘turmae’ (vi. 8, 5 5 ;
vii 45, 5 13 viii. 18, 55 a, 3), and had- Roman officers called
‘decuriones' (i. 23, 5 a). It was commanded as a whole, first
by the young Publius Crassus (i. 52, 5 7), afterwards by
C. Volusenus Quadratus, with the title of ‘praefectus equitum'
(viii. 48‚5 13 cp. C. iii. 60, 5 4). This titleisalso bestowed on
Quintus Atius Varus (viii. 28, 5 a), who may have been
intermediate between the two.

The aid which Caesar derived from the Gauls was not
confined to cavalry. He did not however count much on the
Gallie infantry, regarding them as rather for show than for
use ¹. At the time of the great revolt he called upon the
Aedui for 10,ooo font-soldiers, which he got, but not for long
(νῆ’ 3425 1)·

We have already had occasion to allude to the mixed force of
cavalry and infantry which Caesar imported from beyond the
Rhine (vii. 65,5 4) ¹. Besides these foreigners he had in his
service Numidian and Cretan archers and Balearic elingers
