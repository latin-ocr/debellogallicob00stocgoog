12 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

Caesar might have lied with comparative impunity, had he
been so minded; in the former he could not, and we inser that
he did not, since no single statement in the Civil War has
been controverted by his countrymen, the only demurrer that
has reached us being this vague growl of Pollio's, which is
unsubstantiated by details.

There isone point, however, which we must concede to our
critic, namely, that on questions ol natural history Caesar showed
himself of too confiding a disposition. Some oi the beasts with
which he has peopled the Hercynian Forest (B. G. vi. 25-8)
had certainly not fallen under his own observation. But a charge
like this is not special to Cacsar, but common to the writers ol
antiquity, and tells with teulold iorce against others. In those
days the world was young, and either Nature was more erratic
then than now ot her course had not been so definitely ascer-
tained. Within the range of their immediate experience men
loolred ior uniformity: beyond that everything was possible.
There is something ol the same spirit leit among ourselves. No

one expects Mahatmas in Cheapside, but we are willing to
accept them in Thibet.
Hisgenerat On the whole then our review of the writers as nearly

contemporaneous to Caesar as possible tends only to strengthen
ourlconfidence in his statements. He had the veracity which
Aristode tells usis characteristic ol theman oi great soni.
We may feel pretty sure that the way ol truth for us lies in
squaring our theories with Caesar’s statements, not in the
converse process.

Why did Caesar call his work ‘ Commentaries’? The word
is not one that quite carries its meaning on the suriam,
especially aster it has been overlaid with associations foreign
to its primary sense. It is employed both in the masculine
and in the neuter gender. In theone case we may supply
volumen, in the other leber, as Aulus Gellius does lor us¹.
