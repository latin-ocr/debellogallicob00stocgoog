DE BELLO GALLICO. LIB. VII 245

believes him to be disguising the truth in this instance. There is
a story in Plutarch (J. C. 26) that the Arverni had a sword hanging
in one of their temples, which they declared to be a trophy won
from Caesar. Caesar, he adds, only smiled when he saw it there,
and refused to have it taken down. Servius commenting on
the passage in Vergil (Aen. xi. 743), where Tarchon wrenches
Venulus fully armed from his horse, says that the incident is taken
from history, for that the thing happened to Caesar when he was
fighting in Gaul. But one of the enemy recognising him as he
was being carried away by his antagonist, shouted out, ‘ Caesar,
Caesar,' which in Gallie means ‘ Let him go,’ and he was let go.
This story is given to us on the authority of Caesar himself in his
‘ Diary ’ (Ephemm's), where he is dwelling on his own good
fortune! Even if there is any truth in the narrative, there is no
particular reason for assigning it to this occasion, beyond the fact
that Caesar was undoubtedly now at the lowest ebb os his fortunes.

Gergovia and directed his march towards the country of the
Aedui. The enemy did not pursue, and he crossed the Allier by
repairing some of the broken bridges. Here he was informed
by Viridomarus and Eporedorix that Litaviccus had set out with
all the cavalry (of the Arvernians it would appear) to gain over
the state to the side of the rebels. It was necessary t'or them,
they said, to go in advance with a view to counteracting his
designs. Caesar charged them to remind their countrymen of
his services and let them go. We may surmise that they took
with them the 10,ooo infantry. The last link with the Aedui was
now snapped. There was a town in their territory called N oviodu·
num, which is generally identified with Nevers. Here Caesar had
lest the hostages from Gaul, as well as corn, money, horses, and
stores of war generally. The Aedui slew the guards of this depot
and possessed themselves of the spoil. Their next step was to
endeavour to prevent his passage of the Loire, which was swollen
by snows. But Caesar was too quick sor them and crossed the
river by a ford where the water ran breast high. On the right
bank he obtained abundant supplies of corn and attic, and,
having replenished his army with these, he directed his march
towards Sens.
Meanwhile Labienus, without having suffered a repulse, like the
