to pass—the hunter state, the nomad state, 3ηά the agricultural State os
state. In which os these were the Germans in the time os affl*
Caesar? The answer seems to be that they were in all three.
When they were not engaged in war or brigandage, most of
their time was spent in hunting (iv. 1, 5 83 vi. 21, 5 3). Their
sole riches even in the time of Tacitus (G. 5, 5 2) consisted in
cattle, and Caesar (vi. 35, 5 6) himself has noticed their avidity
sor this living money. At the same time they did raise cropS‚
though nothing but grain, and never in the same plaoe two
years running (iv. r, 5 73 vi. 22, 5 2). Under pressure of
circumstances they were even more ready than the Boers of
South Africa to ‘ trek ’ off in their wagonS, 3ηά seek ‘ fresh
woods and pastures new ¹.' Situated as they were geographioelly
between the purely nomad Sarmatians (Mela iii. 5 34 ς Tac. G.
46, 5 2) and the comparatively settled inhabitants of Gaul, their
manner of life also seems to have been intermediate between
that os their neighbours on either side. This facility of migra-
tion is noted by Strabo as the great characteristic of the
GermanS, and it is entirely in keeping with what Caesar
(iv. 1, 5 7 ; vi. 22, 5 2) says of the absence from among them of
any private property in land. The tribes indeed had territorieS,
which they sought to secure from invasion by keeping as large
a belt as possible of waste land about them ², but beyond this
the institution of landed property does not appear to have gone.
‘ Every year,’ says Caesar (vi. 22, 5 2), ‘ the magistrates and
chiefs assign to families and clans of men, in a general assembly,
as much land as they think fit, and where they think fit, and
a year aster compel them to pass on to somewhere else ;' 3ηά
when he is speaking specially of the Suebi (iv, 1, 5 7), on whom
no doubt his account of the Germans generally is based, he
says», ‘ nor is it lawful for thern to remain more than a year in
one spot, to inhabit it? Among other reasons which the

Germans are made by Caesar (vi. 22, 5 3) to assign for this
