nearly alone ln charging them with extreme profligacy, and with
the unnatural vice which was so common among the Greeks
and even among the Romans ¹.
The ancient writers love to dwell on the savagery ol the Early
Gauls-how they would hang the heads of their enemies from 'mm

their horses’ necis, and then nail thern up on their houses, as

a hunter does the trophies os th'e beasts he has slain; and how
they would preserve those ot' the most famous, stowing them
away in a box, and delighting to show them to visitors, whom
they would inform with pride that they had refused to part with
them for their weight in gold (D. S. v. 29, §i 4, 55 Str. iv. 4,
ξ 5). Diodorus tells us these things without mentioning his
authority, but when we turn to Strabo we find that they come
from Posidonius. That philosopher relates how he olten saw
human heads hung up on the portals oi houses, and how, though
the sight at first gave hirn a turn, yet he soon got used to it.
Posidonius visited Gaul some thirty or torty years before the
time ol Caesar. The manners of the Gauls seem to have been
mitigated in the interval, for we do not derivs this impression of
extreme savagery from Caesar, except in so lar as concerno
the practices connected with religion, of which we shall spealr

advanced nations with whom they came into contact¹. They
had their own philosophy, their own poetry‚ their own oratory‚
and their own mechanic arts independently of instruction from
others, and we know how their aptitude ior imitation impressed
the mind ol Caesarlvii. ηδ 1).
