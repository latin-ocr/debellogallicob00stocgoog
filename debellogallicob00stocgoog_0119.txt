among the Gauls as notorious ¹. Diodorus Siculus, Strabo,
Mela, Lucan, Minucius Felir,and lactantiushaveallsomethingto
say about them. The first oi these writers informs us thet the
holocausts ol which Caesar speaks (vi. 16, §i 4, 5) were offered to
the gods at intervals oi five years (D. S. v. 32, ξ 6). He agrees
with Strabo in saying that they contained other victims besides
men. Livy ·conlirms these other authorities by speaking oi
captives being sacrificed by the Gauls in Asia Minor
(Liv. xxxviii. 47 ad fin). How soon these barbarities might

Ι have died out, had the Gauls been leit to themselves, we cannot

tell ; ior as a matter ol lact they were suppressed by the Roman
government (Str. iv. 4, § 5). Mela mentions (iii. ξ 18) that even
in his time vestiges oi these grim rites remained Though
murder was no longer committed in the name oi religion, yet
a human victim was moved up to the altar, and the initiatory
rites performed upon him. lt is interesting to notice that
among the Romans themselves similar practices were only
officially abolished by a decree os the Senste passed in the
rw uc· 97¹·

Pliny adds that the ‘magle' with which he connects the
Druids flourished still so much in Britain, that it might almost
be thought to have been borrowed thence hythe Persians. It
was irom this island that their religion, at once so awlul and
sinister, spread itsell into Gaul, and it was hither that those
students repaired who wished thoroughly to explora its mysteries
