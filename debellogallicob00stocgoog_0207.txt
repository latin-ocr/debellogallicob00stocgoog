In addition ιο the forces which have been enumerated as Troops
serving under Caesar himself, there were twenty-two cohorts {2¹¹2ssae
in garrison in the Provinoe, which were utilised by his ltinsman
and ‘legatus' Lucius Caesar, when the tideus war turned
against the Romans and the Province itseli was invaded

From the constituent parts oi the army we now turn to its (a)1ts offi-

personalty, and must say something about its officers and other ffiffic,

functionaries timeris.
When the officers have tobe spoken ol collectively, as opposed The

to the men, they are called by the vague name ‘duces' ; but in 'mam
a special sense there was only one ‘dum' and that was the
‘imperator‚' who had the auspices Caesar speaks of Marius

(i. 40, 5 5) and also of himself (ii. 25, 5 3) as ‘imperat0r.' It
was not necessary for a general ιο have been proclaimed
‘imperator' on the field by his soldiers in order to be called by
that name, though that does seem to have been a condition

army (C. ii. 26, 5 r 3 cp. 32, 5 14),sneers at Scipio, the father·
in·law ot' Pompey,ashaving assumed the title in consequence ol
some reverses in Cilicia, and mentions how Pompey himself was
given it by his soldiers on the field os victory at Dyrrhachium,
but did not assume it in his despatches nor wear the laurei ior
the slaughter of his countrymen (C. iii. γι, 5 3). lt was Caesar
who began the practice, continued by the emperors, of using
‘imperator' as a praenomen (Suet. J. C. 76).

The special dress ol the commander-in-ehief was the purple
‘paludamentum' in which he went srom the Capitol after the
solemn utterance oi public prayer (C. i. 6, 5 6; Liv. xxi. 63,
558, 9). Caesar (vii. 88, 5 ι) gives us ιο understand that he
