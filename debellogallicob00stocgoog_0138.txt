tant part in the pharmacopoeia of the Ancients, being regarded
as a specific against the quinsy and against snake-bites, provided
it vas gathered before thunder vas heard, might seem from its
name to have reached the Romans from our island: but this
appears not to bave been the case, although it grevv there among
other places (Plin. N. H. xxv. 5 ao ; xxvii. 5 a).

The supposed mineral wealth of Britain attracted the cupidity
of the Romans. Tacitus, like Strabo, talks of its possessing
gold, silver, and other metals, which made it worth while to
conquerit. Caesar himself (v. ra, 5 4) appears to mention
gold coins as being in use in Britain. The reading, it is true,
is very doubtful, but it is supported hythe views of numismatists,
who hold that gold coins vere struck in Britain about a century
before Caesar's landing. However that may be, Caesar himself
got no gold out of the country. For we find Cicero, who vas
in correspondenee with his brother Quintus, and with Caesar
himself, when they were in Britain, writing to Trebatius then in
Gaul, ‘I hear that there is no gold or silver in Britain' (nd

Fam. vii 7,5 r). He expresses himself to the same effect to
Atticus (iv. 16, 5 13) with regard to silver, ‘This also is now
ascertained, that there is not a scruple of silver in that island,
nor any hope of booty, except from slaves, among whom

Expressions lilce these, however, cannot be pressed as evidence
for the absence of the precious metals, especially as Cicero
himself (Ad Att. iv. 17, 5 3) speaks of a money tribute as
having been imposed upon Britain by Caesar on his departure ¹.

Of iron Caesar (v. ια, 5 5) says that it was found on the sea·
coast, but only in small quantities. This doubtless means that
only the natives of the south coast had the skill to extract it

¹ Caesar himself (r. aa, 5 4) uses the word ‘ vectigal,' which might be
taken to indicate that the tribute was to be paid ln kind Diodorus Siculus
(v. αι, 5 a) however says-nol τοὺς Πρεττανοὺς καταπολεμήσας ἠνάγκασε
τελῶ ὡρισμένους φόρου, and Suetonius (J. C. ²5) ‘Aggreasus et Britannos,
ignotos antea; superatisque pecunias et obsides imperavit'
