The first mention that we have oi the maniple in Caesar is The,
when in the battle on the Sambre he gives the order ‘laxare mmm*
manipulos' (ii. 25, l a). In vi. 34, l 6 he speaks ol the theory

and practioe oi the Roman army requiring that the maniples

should be kept about the standards l‘ ad signa ') on the march

In Caesar's army there was no Roman cavalry. That arm ol Cemr'e
the service consisted entirely of auxiliary troops. This was why ‘mhi‘
the crafty Ariovistus stipulated that there should not be a single
lom-soldier at the conierence (i. 42, § 4), and why Caesar had
recourse to the expedient ol mounting his trusty Tenth It
shows the marvellous training ol the Roman legionary that such
a manoeuvre was possible. Imagine Tommy Atlrins being
suddenly called upon to act as a ‘plunger'l But it was part ol
the exercise ol the Roman soldier to vault into the saddle, at first
unarmed, and then armed, and this either from right or lrorn leit.
Wooden horses were provided him to practise on, under cover in
the winter and during summer in the open (Veget. i. 18).

At the outset os his first campaign Caesar had a force oi
4,ooo cavalry, collected partly from the Province and partly
irorn the Aedui and their allies (i 15, l ι).

ln his Belgian campaign oi nc. 57 the cavalry oi the Treviri,
who had a high reputation ior courage, were sent by the State to
his assistance, but proved oi little service, as in the battle oi the
Sambre they too hastily ooncluded that the Romans were
defeated, and rode off with the news to their countrymen (ii. 24,
δὴ, 5). In the operations against the Usipetes and Tencteri

(sc. 55) Caesare cavalry amounted to 5,ooo, a iorce which
