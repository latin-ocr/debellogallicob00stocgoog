CHAPTER VII
nne aouau aaut

Harum spoken already oi the general and oi the enemy, it Sonreee
now remains ior us to say something about the instrument
wherewith the general overcame the enemy. That instrument
was the Roman army. We are concerned with it only as it
was in the time of Caesam but the two most detailed accounts
oi it which we possess were written, one oi them some two
centuries before, the other at least four centuries after that date.

The former is by Polybius, who brought down his history to

sc. 146, the year which marked the fan oi Carthage and, what
to him was more vital, oi Corinth; the latter is by Vegetius,
who wrote after the death nithe Emperor Gratian (an. 383) ¹.
The account which Polybius gives oi the Roman army, as it Polybius
was in the days oi the younger Africanus, is the basis oi all
our knowledge on this subject. It has the peculiar vslue ior us
oi being written by one who, though intimately acquainted with

the Roman military system, was still a ioreigner writing ior
ioreigners, and so thinks it worth his while to explain things,
the knowledge oi whieh a Roman addressing his countrymen
would take ior granted. The same sort oi interest attacbes to

¹Aoeording to Gabbon, Decllne and Fail, dcc, end oi ch ay, the
emperor, to whom the work oi Vegetins is dedicandis Valentinian 111,
a· n. 4² μεθ 'lhls is also the opinion oi the Teubner editor, Karl lang.
