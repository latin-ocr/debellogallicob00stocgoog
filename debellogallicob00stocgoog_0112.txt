106 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

number oi these tribes is variously estimmed. On the altar in
the temple of Augustus at Lyon, which was raised to him by all
the Gauls, sixty tribes were mentioned (Str. iv. 3, ξ ²h But
Josephus, who is a well-informed author, speaks os no less than
305 (B. J. ii. 16, p. 188). The possibility of such diverse
estimates is no doubt due to the way in which petty tribes were
grouped round more important ones as their dependants, so
that they might either be included in thern or rechoned sepa-
rately. Strabo speaks oi fifteen tribes ol Belgae (Str. iv. 4, § 3),
and more than twenty small tribes in Caesar's Aquitania (Str. iv.
a, 1.

hingala {choe tribes in Caesar's time were mostly lree, though their

⁰²²¹ constitution was decidedly aristocratical. Every now and then
however we meet with a tribe that was under kingly government.
Thus Galba (ii 4‚§ 7) was lring os the Suessiones, and before
him there had been a king Divitiacus; Teutomatus (vii. gr, d 5)
was lring oi the Nitiobriges, and his lather Ollovico had reigned
beiore him; Ambiorix and Catuvoleus were kings ol the

Eburones (v. 24, § 43 vi. 31, 5 5). Adiatunnus is said by
Caesar to have held the supreme command, which might mean
only that he was general ol the forces, but Nicolaus oi Damascus

calls him King oi the Sotiani (=Sontiates) (Athen. vi 54b,
p. 249). There appears however to have been a great move·

rnent towards freedom just before the time of Caesar's invasion
ol Gaul. Thus the Sequani bad been under a king Catamanta-
loedis (i. 3, §4); the ancestors oi Tasgetius had reigned over
the Carnutes (v. 25, ξ ι); Moritasgus had been king ol the
Senones, in suecession to his progenitors, when Caesar came
into Gaul (v. 54, 5 a). The descendants of these dethroned
monarchs constituted a disturbing element in the country.
They were ready to scheme, like Casticus (i. 3, ς 4), sor the
recovery os a father's sovereignty‚ or to accept at the hands ol
Caesar the throne from which their ancestors had been expelled
by their own people, as was the case with Tasgetius and
Cavarinus, the tormer ol whom pald for his temerity with his
