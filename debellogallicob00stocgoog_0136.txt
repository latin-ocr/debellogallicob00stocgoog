ascribe a blunder ol this kind to Caesar's copyists than to
Caesar himself. He had learnt something about the tides by
the time he sat down to write his work Amatter ol practical
concern os this kind is the very last on which he is likely to
have continued in error.

Prectteal Caesar's statements have a ring os actual experience about

has drawn his experience from books If he dwells on the
boisterous waves and violent winds ol the ocean (iii 8, 5 ι; 14,
556, 7, 9), it is because he had iound how ill his Mediterranean·
built galleys were fitted to cope with them, though that sea itseli
can raise very respectable waves when it is in the mood to do
so. Some indeed who have crossed from Dover to Calais might
leel inclined to dispute his observation that the waves in the
strait rise less high than elsewhere3 nevertlreless it must be
admitted that there is truth at the bottom ot* it, even ifwe
question his explanation ol the fact as being due to the frequent
changes in the tide (v. r, 5 a). Very different from such state·

the waters round the north coast oi Britain, ‘which yield with
difficulty to the oar and are hardly raised by the winds' (Agr.
10). Il Agricola's sailors could get round Cape Wrath, and
then give anything like this as the result of their experience‚
they must have been singularly fortunate in their weather.

as the country lay so lar to the north. Experience, however,
corrected this impression. Caesar (v. ra, 5 6) remarks that the
