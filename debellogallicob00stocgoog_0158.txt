154 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

Germania Ol the position ol the Angli, or, as they are here
called, Anglii (G. 40, i ι), Tacitus can only vaguely tell us
that they lived somewhere beyond the Langobardi. Ptolemy
(ii. ιι, § 15), who calls them Ἀγγιιλοὶ, is more precise, placing
them eastward os the Langobardi and on the middle reaches
ol the Elbe. He speaks ol them as an important people and
a branch of the Suebi. The Saxona are placed by the same
geographer (ii. rr, § ιι) between the Elbe and the neck
ol the Cimbn'c Chersonese, that is, in what is now called
Holstein.

The accounts then which Caesar and other writers give of
the Germans concern us at least as much as those os Britain,
and in dealing with the great German racc we are going back
to the rock whence we were hewn.

To Caesar Germany was simply the country beyond the
Rhine: he does not attempt to assign its boundaries or to

No omes· estimate its size He tells us (vi. 25, ξι) that the Germans
ἔξω themselves had no measures oi distance, and could only estimate
amno gthe the length ol a joumey by the time it took a lightly equipped
G mans. traveller to perform rt. One rs reminded ol this remark ol our
author in certain parts os Germany at the present day, as, for

instance, in the Saxon Switzerland and the adjacent parts ol
Bobemia, where the sign-posta announce only the number

oi hours and minutes from one salient point to another,

though the English toun'st is apt to conclude that these
measures are not based on the walking powers os an expeditus

Romaanus Mela( § 19) tells ns that the Germans reach as far as the

Ὢ Sarmatae, and then on to Asia He makes their country to

be bounded on the west by the Rhiue‚ on the south by the
Alps, on the east by the borders of the Sarmatae, and on the
north by the Ocean (Μ 25). This roughly coincides with
what is said by Tacitus (G. μᾷ ι), that Germany is divided
from the Gauls by the Rhine, from the Raetians (who lived
in the Alps, Str. vii. r,§ 5) and Pannonians by the Danube,
from the Dacians by mountains, and from the Sarmatae by
