Wood‚ about a mile from Wye ou the north side of the river.
F mm Wye he conjectures that Caesar went to Dorking and then
down the left bank of the Mole to the nearest point of the Thames
He is inclined to accede to the tradition that Caesar crossed the
Thames at the point known as Cowey or Coway Stakes‚ a little
above Walton and below Weybridge, though he thinks that the
famous stakes themselves, which are referred to hy the Venerable
Bede as having been planted by Cassivellaunus (Ecclrllist Ι. 2),
must have been the pilea of an ancient bridge· No oue need look
for these stakes now, but the place where they once stood is ‘at the
distance of a furlong to the west of the northern end of Walton
Bridge' Lastly, the town of Cassivellaunus he considers to bethe
ancient Verulam or St. Albana.

The Emperor Napoleon 111, on the other hand, who had
Mr. Lewin’s reasoning before him, lands Caesar at Deal, repre·
sents the barbarians as drawn up to oppose him on the heights of
Kingston beyond the Little Stour, makes Caesar march to the
Thames by Maidstone and westerham, and cross it perhaps at
Snnbury. He inclines to accept St. Albane as the ‘oppidum’ of
Cassivellaunus. This is the sole point in which the two writers
agree, and for this there is no evidence. As regards time the
two authorities are much better agreed than aa regards place.
Mr. Lewin ealcumer that Caesar sailed for Britain on July 183
the Emperor makes it the zoth. Both agree that he left Britain
finally on September 21, but Mr. lewin arrives at this conclusion
by a calamum: of the tides, while the Emperor takes it from
Cicero (ad Art iv. 17, § 3), who says that he had received letters
from his brother Quintus and from Caesar when they were in the
act of departing from Britain, and that these letters were dated
the 6th day before the Kalends of October. Now this is theday
which in Le Verrier’s tables corresponds to September 21.

After his return from Britain Caesada first care was to hold out
at Amiens (Samarobriva) the ‘conucil of the Gauls ⁹ which he had
instituted for his own purposes; his next was to arrange the
winter-quartem of his army. The harvest had been bad owing to
the dryness of the seusun, so that he was obliged to scatter his
forces over a wide area.

There are eight and a half legions mentioned. The following
scheme represents their distribution among the tribes of northern
