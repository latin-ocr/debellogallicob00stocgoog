and at the same time supplies us with the exact figures bv
which that conclusion was reached.

Strabo himself does not venture on any estimate as to the
siae os Britain, except as regards the south coast, which he
declares to be the longest, and which he tells us is exactly
coextensive with that ol Gaul, the latter being measured from
the mouths ol the Rhine to the northern heighls ol the Pyrenees
in Aquitania Kent, according to hirn, was opposite to the
mouths ol the Rhine, and the Land’s End to the Pyrenees.
Eacb coast he says is about 4,300 or 4,4oo stades (= 550
Roman miles) ¹. In order to understand these extraordinary
statements we must bear in mind that in Strabo’s view the coast
ol Gaul ran in one unbrolren line from the Rhine to the
Pyrenees ; he had no idea oi the Bay of Biscay. Moreover he
thought that the Pyrenees ran from south to north and were
pretty nearly parallel to the Rhine (iv. 1, § r, p. 177 ; cp. iv. a,
ir, p· 190).

Pliny takes no notice ol Caesar’s estimate, but says that
Agrippa put the length ol the island at 800 miles and the
breadth at 300. It does not appear that Agrippa himself ever
visited Britain, but he was more than once in Gaul, and was
ahigh authority on geography, as he made an official map os
the world (Plin. N. H. iii. § 17: cp. iv. § 81).

Tacitus, though he had the advantage of the explorations
made by his father-inlaw Agricola, was too much occupied
with pictoresque description to condescend to statistics. He is
content to say that it was the largest island known to the
Romans. By the time of Dio Cassius, who wrote, not only
alter the conquests os Agricola, but alier those ol Severus, the
dimensions of Britain ought to have been more exactly
determined. But the length os the island is still more
exaggerated by that writer (lxxvi. ra), who puts it at ’μμ stades
(=8913 Roman miles), than it is by Caesar and Agrippa As

which he criticizes Pytheas
