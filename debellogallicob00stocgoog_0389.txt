DE BELLO caturco. ΜΒ. V 159

Sabinus, but as being forced into an attach on the camp as part of
aconcerted movement3 he added that a large body os Germans
had crossed the Rhine‚ and would be on the spot in two days; in
conclusion be promised a salecondnct to the Romans, is they
would relieve his country ol' winter-quartem by withdrawing to
the camp os Cicero or Labienus The words of Ambiorix were
reported to the lieutenants and a council os war was called. Cotta
and most ol the officere were in favour oi staying where they were
and deiyiug any number oi Germans3 Sabinus was strongly in
favour oi withdrawing, and hia opinion ultimately prevailed. At
daybrealr next morning they set out from the camp with a long
train oi baggage, but they had not gone more than two miles before
they tell into an ambush oi the enemy. The Romans were obliged
to abendon their baggage and form into a circle, in which order
they managed to hold out until about two o’cloclr in the at'ternoon.
Then their losses induoed Sabinus to sue lor terma Ambiorix
ordered him and the officers who accompanied him to lay down
their arms ; they did so and were treacherously murdered. Cotta
died fighting along with most oi the men. The residue returned
into their camp, where they held out with difficulty till nightfall‚
and then slew themselves. A few esmped from the field and found
tbeir way to the camp ot' Labienus, which was more than fifty
miles distant

Elated with victory, Ambiorix rode on into the neighbouring
territory oi the Aduatuci, ordering the loot forces to follow him,
and then into that ol the Nervii. The three tribes with all their

vassals tell with lury upon the camp os Cicero. But the energy oi
tbe deience was equal to that oi the attaclr. Quintus, though in
ill health, did not rest evenat night, until he was forced by his
men to spare himself. Then the chieis os the Nervii who were
acquainted with the lieutenant made the same representatione and
offers to him that bad been made to Sabinus, informing him ln
addition oi the sate oi that commander. But Cicero’s only reply

was that, ir they wanted terma, they must lay down their arms.
Alter this the Gauls began to invest the camp in Roman lashion,
as well as they could without the necessary tools. On the seventh
day oi the siege they managed to set fire to the soldiers' huts,
which were thatched with straw atterite manner of the country,
and at the same time made a desperate assault upon the rampart.
