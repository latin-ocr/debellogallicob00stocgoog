ramparts'3 Ambarri (=Ambiarari), the dwellers on both banks
ol the Arar. The names ol places in the same way yielda
meaning under the comparative method. Briva, which occurs
at the end of so many names os towns, means ‘iord’ as in
Samarobriva, ‘the sord of the Summe! Magus, another
common termination, means a field, as in Rigomagus, ‘the
king's field! Bn‘ga is a burg or stronghold3 dunum a hill·

We must inquire now into the physieal characteristics of the {iulos the
au S.

people who spolie this language.

The first thing that struck a Greek or Roman observet about‘
the Gauls was their sire. Caesar has commented on this
(ii 30,§ 4), and so have all the writers who deal with them

(eg. D. S. v. 28, ξ r 3 Α. Μ. xv. 12‚§ 13 Paus. x. ao, ξ 4).

Nor was this size in one dimension only, their bodies being apt

to become bloated by too much indulgence in fond and drink,
though at an earlier period, according to Ephorus, they fought
against this tendency, having a certain measure of girth, which

the young men were punished if they exceeded (Str. iv. 4, ξ 6,

ad fin.; App. iv. 7). We hear also of the moist white flesb

oi the Ganls¹ in contrast with that oi the southern nations, who
were spare, dark men. These physical characteristics ol the
Gauls put them at a disadvantage in one respect in combating

the wir-y Romans. Roman endurance toolr the shape ol a
tolerance ol hest, dust, and thirst, which were just the things
which the Gauls were least able to' bear. They soon lost breath

and began tonan with sweat. Their bodies, it was observes,

had something about them ol the snows oi their own Alps,

and melted under the heat ol the sun (Flor. i. ao).

Tm Ancients had a respectlul admiration lor the women ol Their

the Gauls, who are described as large and sair, and brave and ὈΜ
strong (D. S. v. 32, ξς a, 7; Α. Μ. xv. ra,§1). Ammianus
