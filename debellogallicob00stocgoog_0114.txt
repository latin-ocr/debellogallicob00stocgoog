103 CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

between three orders in this class. Strabo calls these three
orders Bardi, Vates, and Dryadae. Those who with Strabo are
Vates (οὐάτιις) are by Diodorus Siculus called μάντεις, and by
Ammianus Marcellinus ‘euhagis' which issupposed to represent
the Gellic name (Str. iv. 4, 5 4, D. S. v. 31, 55 r, 3; A. Μ. xv.
9, 5 8). The difference ol function between these three orders
is represented thus. The bards were minstrels and poete, who
chanted the deeds os heroes on the lyre and devoted their friends
and enemies to eulogy or execrationi The Vates were diviners,
who were believed to penetrate into the future by means oi
augury and the inspection of victims and to explore the secrets
of nature. The Druids proper were the highest oi the three
orders. They were philosophers who to the ‘physiology’ or
natural science os the Vates superadded the study of ethics.
One would like to have been present at those meetings in Rome

· in which the Druid Divitiacus expounded his notions of philo-

sophy to Marcus Tullius 3ηά his brother Quintus (cientur.
5 pol: but, as it is, we must be content to know merely that the
Druids taught the doctrines ol the immortality oi the soul and oi
the universe, but thought that the latter was liable to be con·
vulsed by fire and water (vi. 14, 5 6 ; Mela iii.§ 19).

There is no doubt but that the religion ol the Gauls contained
in it higber elements thanthat ol the Greeks and Romans,
in spite ol the bloody and barbarous rites by which it was
¹defrled. The classical nations went to the priest ior their ritual
and to the philosopher or legislator for their morality, but in the
Gallic religion these two factors were combined. To the
layrnan among the Gauls, whether gentle or simple, religion
presented itseli as the guide os lise, clothed in the awful sanctities
ol the unseen world, 3ηά informed by a knowledge to which he
himself did not aspire. Hence the strong hold that it exer·
cised over the minds oi the masses. The Druids were a real
spiritual power, like the Catholic Church ol the Middle Ages. ,
They could intervene on the battlefield and stop the rage ol
hosts breathing slaughter (D. S. v. 31, 5 53 Str. iv. 4, 5 4).
