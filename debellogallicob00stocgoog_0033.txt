THE corrueremus 5

and his birth is put at about 155 a n, that is to say, just two
centuries aiter Caesaffs first landing in Britain.

Plutarch's account os the Gallie War (Caesar 18·27), though Plutarch:
brieier than that ol Dio Cassius, is perhaps more important.
Plutarch speaks ol himself (De E apud Delphos, 385 B)as being
a young man when Nero usited Greece, which was in a. u. 66-7.
A person of his omnivorous reading can hardly be expected to
be accurate; and he makes some exaggerated statements, which
might easily have been corrected bya glauce at Caesar’s own
writings In the main he is manifestly following Caesar
himself, but there are some points in which he seenu to be
drawing upon independent evidence. Thus be tells us emphati-
cally that it was not Caesar in person, but Labienus acting
under his orders, who achieved the first success in the
Helvetiae War by cutting to pieces the Tigurini. We should
certainly never have gathered tbis from the Commentarios
(i. tal: but the statement is repeated in two fragments oi
Appian (Lib. iv. De Reb. Gall. 3 and 15), and we cannot
lightly set it aside.

hgain in the matter os the Usipetes and Tencteri Plutarch,
aiter quoting the rather suspicions account given by Caesar in
bis Commentaries ¹, os bis negotiations with those unfortunate
barbarians, goes on to tell us, on the authority oi alost writer,
that when the Senate was voting a supplication (cp. B. G. iv.
38, ξ 5) in honour os Caesar‘s victories, Cato proposed that he
should be surrendered to the enemy in atonement for the
violation ol the truce. The writer quoted by Plutarch appears
in his text as Τανύσιος. He bas been identified with the
Tanusius Geminus, whose Historia is quoted by Suetonius
(J. C. 9) as one of the authorities lor Caesar's period. This
Tanusius it bas been thought may be the same as the Tanusius,
ol whose Annales Seneca (Epist. xciii. ad fin.) expresses so
low an opinion as a tedious and worthless productiori.
