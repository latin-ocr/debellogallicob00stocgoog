high road from Paris to Perpignan. The spot is near the present
railway station oi Le CendreOrget. The Emperor has registered
his opinion on a none with the inscription-

‘Camp occupd per Jnles Cesar
l'an 52 avant J. C!

The exact dimensione os the camp even are indicated by arrows
on the two convergent sides oi the stone marked 467 mitres and
646aonn respectively. According to the same authority the hill
which Caesar captured (36, ξ 5), and where he established his
smaller camp, was la Roche Blanche, which lies nearly due south
of Gergovia.

But against this view there are certain objections that may be
urged.

ln the first place, as Caesar approached Gergoviairom the north,
marching up the bank of the Allien (34, ᾗ 2), it is perhaps natural
to suppose that he attacked the town from that quarta, unless
we are told something to the contrary. ln the next place Caesar
tells us that the hill he captured was ‘e regione oppidi’ (36, ς 5).
Now as a straight line can be drawn from any one point to any
other, this description could not be employed intelligibly by Caesar
except in reference to some third point, which would presumably

’ be his own camp. We are therefore led to inser that the hill

captured lay in a straight line between Caesars camp and the
town. Napoleon's plan however makes the small camp lorrn the
apex οἰ a triangle with a line between the oppidum and the large
camp lor its base. Again‚ Caesar speaks os the hill in question
as being ‘egregie munitus atque ex omni parte circumcisus,'a
description which is not applicable to La Roche Blanche3 sor,
though on the south side, where it overhangs the village, it is
extremely precipimus, yet on the north side it presente an easy
slope Further‚ ii Caesar stood on La Roche Blanche, he could
see lor himself any operatione that were taking place on the
‘dorsum silvestre et angustum: whereas it is evident from the
account in 44 that he could not discern these from the smaller
camp.
