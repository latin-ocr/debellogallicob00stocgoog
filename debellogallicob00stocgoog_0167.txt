uses rursus, and Galen (xv. 185) goes out of his way to say that
the Germane were not ξανθοί but πυρροί. It seems then that we
ought not to think of the hair of the ancient Germana as of the
same light blonde oolour as that of the modern Swede. But we
must remember that the prevailing hue was to a great extent
artificial. We bave seen already (p. 94) that the Gauls took
care that their children’s locks should conform to the regulation
type of ruddy gold3 and the Germans imitated their practice in
this particular. Pliny (N. H. xxviii. ξ 191) informs us that the
Gauls invented a soap for turning the hair golden (⁸ rutilandis
capillis ⁹) ¹, and that this was more used among the Germans by
the men than by the women. It was a decoction of suet and
wood-ashes, the best sor the purpose being beech or hombeam,
and might be used either in a liquid or solid form. The use os
this dye passed from the barbarians to the Roman Iadica, among
whom it appears to have been known as ⁸ spuma Batava ’ἶ

But if we cannot detect much differenoe in kind, physically Greater
speaking, between the Gauls and Germana, there was at all “Gssgintsse
events a difference in degree. 1f the Gauls were big, the
Germana were still bigger. Caesar (iv. 1, ξ 9) ascribes the aize
aud strength of the latter to their meat diet and their daily
exercise, adding, whimsically enough, the absence of all restraint
stom their childhood. One of the restraints with which the
young German was in no way hampered was clothes. ‘In
every house‚' says TacituS, ‘ naked and dirty, they attain to that
length of limb and that bulk of body which we admire ⁸.'
