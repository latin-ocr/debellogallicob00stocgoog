DE BELLO GALLICO. ΗΒ. II 65

Celtic Gaul, who remained ever after his most faithful allies. They
dmied that they had taken any part in the confederation them·
selues, but declared that all the rest of the Belgae were in arms as
well as the German tribea who dwelt on the near side of the Rhme
This statement must be taken with a slight qualification, for neither
the Mediomatrici, Treveri, or Leuci seem to have played any part
