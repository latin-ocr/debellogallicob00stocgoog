204 · CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

wore this garb in battle, in order to be recognised by his men.
Many generals, we may sunniae, laid it aside, in order not to be
recognised by the enemy.

Next in official dignity to the general in the Roman army
· came the paymaster or ‘ quaestor' (ταμίας), Three night-watcbes
were set round his quartem in the camp, but only two round

those os each oi the ‘legati’ (Polyb, vi. 35, 5 4). Hence Caesar
is following the order of precedence when he says (iv. aa, 5 3)
‘quaestori legatis, praefectisque! The paymaster's quarters
(‘quaeatorium,' τομαῖον) were at the back oi the camp near the

decuman gate (Liv. rr. ga, 5 83 Polyb. wi 31, 5 r). The general
had no power to select his own ‘quaestor,' who was assigned to
him by lot Caesar'a ‘quaestor' is not mentioned by name till
late in the narrative (v. 24,5 3; 46, 5 r 3 vi. 6,5 ι), when we
find him to have been M. Crassus, the son of the triumvir.
Wbether lre was Caesar's first ‘quaestor' in Gaul does not
appear„ He was succeeded by Marcus Antonius (viii. 2,
5 r). Though the special iunctions os tbe ‘quaestor' were
linancial, yet he was utilised, like the ‘legati' ¹for military
commanda ¹..

ln v. 47, 5 a we lind Crassus werp appropriately leit at

Samarobriva with a legion, in charge of the stores of war,
hostages, and state papers.
. ‘Legati' (πρεσβευταί or σύμβουλοι), in their original conception,
· were persons publicly appointed hythe State to assist the
commander. A skilsul soldier, who was not at the time being
in office, could in this way be made use ol in the service oi
his country.

In nc. 190, when the Senate were in doubt whether to assigu
the critical command against Antiochus to Scipio Asiaticus or
to Laelius, the question was at ouce settled when Africanus
offered to go aa ‘legatus' to hia brother (Liv. xxxvii. ι).- In such
a case as this a ‘legatus' might be by force of namre the real
commender: but with a powersul general the ‘legati’ formed
