m C. IULII CAESARIS

He rejoined his army earlier than his wont, but tound that the
Germana were already extending their incursions into the terri·
tories of the Eburones and oi the Condrusi, who were vassals oi
the Treveri. Without hesitation he marcbed against them. While
he was still a lew days off he was met by an embassy. Caesar
refused all terms with the Germana so long as they remained on
Gallie soil, but offered to provide thern with land in the territory oi
the Ubii, whose envoys had come to ask his aid against the Suebi.
The ambassadors promised to report his proposal to their country-
men and to return within three days. Meantime they begged him
to advance no further. Caesar knew that a great partos their

eneampment, slaughtered men, women, and children. The survi·

vors were pursued as iar as the point where the Meuse meets the
Waal, where those who were not slain perished in the waters. So

We baveno clue to the movements oi Caesar or the Germans in

this campaign. Τὴο Emperor Napoleon Ill places the Ambivariti
on the leit bank of the Meuse; M. Desjardins places them on
the right.

Having now had twice to contend with Germans on Gallic soil,
Caesar began to think that a iorward move on the part oi the
Roman legions might make them less ready to invade the country.
So he determined himself to cross the Rhine. He had two osten·
