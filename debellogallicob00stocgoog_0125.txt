Pytheas of Massilia bas been called the Humboldt of anti-
quity. According to his own statement, as preserved to us in
a quotation from Polybius in Strabo (ii. p. 104), he visited all
Britain, so far as it was accessible, and after having returned
from there, traversed the whole ocean-board of Europe from
Gadeira (Cadit) to the Tanais ¹. The scientific results of his
voyages appear to have been published in two works, one of
which we lind referred to as Τὰ περὶ τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ, while the other
is called Γῆς Hcpiodor or nepte-toust

As Pytheos occupies so unique a position with regard to our His date.

nearly as ve ean. Polybius complained of Eratosthenes for
putting saith in Pytheas, adding that Dicaearchus did not (Str.
ii. p. 104) Now Dicaearchus was a disciple of Aristotle
(Cicdeleg.iii.§ 14), and his death is put somevvhere about
ac. ²⁸5· It follows that Pytheas himself must have lived
before this, though how much before it is impossible to say.
This conclusion is confirmed by Pliny (N. H. xxxvii. l 35),
who says that Timaeus (352-256 nc.) accepted Pytheas'
opinion about amber.
