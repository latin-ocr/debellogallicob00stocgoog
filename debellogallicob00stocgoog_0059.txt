hot-headed scions of a noble house, the sons of M. Fabius
Ambustus Finding the Gauls not amenable to reason, they
fought against them contrary to the law of nations, and one of
them Quintus, slew a Gallie chief before the Emrscan lines, and
was recognised by the barbarians as he gathered the spoils.
The more fiery spirits among the Gauls wished to march on
Rome at onoe, but the elders insisted that ambassadors should

open Colline Gate. We need not pursue the well-known tale.

peges oi llvy. Suffice it to say that Rome was sacked and
burnt to the ground. The eacltle ofa goose then determined
the course of history. For ifthe Capitol had been taken in that

night-attach which was foiled by Manlius, Rome would never
have arisen from its ashes; and if there bad been no Rome,
what would Europe have been like today? Perhaps we might
