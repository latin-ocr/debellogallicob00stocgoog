the same time be concedes to Tacitus (G. 9, l 33 43. § 5) that
the German gods were not represented by images. Here we
are iace to lace with a flat contradiction between ancient and
modern authority. It is not necessary to maintain the infalli-
bility of an author simply because one happens to be editing
him. Ι must therefore leave it to more competent judges to
decide between Caesar and the great German philologist But
one remark I will venture to make at the risk of incurring
a charge of temerity. Religion, strange to say, is generally an
exotic product: very sew natione have evolved aud retained
their own. Now a good many things may have happened in
the century and a half that intervenes between Caesar and
Tacitus. Perhaps somebody may yet be found to maintain
that the gods whom the Germans were worshipping in the time
oi Tacitus were imported t'rom Gaul ¹.

¹ Cp. Caes B. G. ri. 17 with Tac. G. 9. Is lt possible that the kings
os the Thracians, os whom Herodotus (v. 7) says eddom« Ἐρμῆν μάλιστα
θεῶν, were oi Celtic origin? Their haring e separate worship from their
subjecte would seem to argue a difference ol racc.
