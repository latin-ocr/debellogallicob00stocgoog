162 CAESAR'S castre tm

Pbysiul war oi the Germana over the Gauls oi his day hy saying that
{effi the latter had been enervated by contact with the provinces and

mad by the importation oi foreign luxuries Other writers carried

cerrum out this hint oi Caesam in a more pronounced way, and-

persisted to the end in seeing no difference but one of degree
between the Gaul and the German. ‘Take aGaul,' says Strabo
(vii t, 5 a: cp. iv. 4, ς a) in effect, ‘make him fiercer, bigger,
more yellowhaired, and you have the dweller beyond the Rhine,
rightly called by the Romans Germanus, as being a genuine,
unadulterated savage.' In the physical descriptione os the two
races given by ancient writers, there is nothing hy which we
can discriminate Gauls from Germana In connexion with
both we hear oi fieres, glaring eyes, yellow or golden hair,
white limbs and huge stature. The only differenee, is it isone,
appears to be that, whereas the eyes oi the Germana are
generally represented as blne, the colour of those oi the Gaulo
does not appear to be mentioned ¹. The usual epithets
employed by Roman writers to describe the hair oi the Germans

are slavus and rutilus, which appear to have the same meaning²;
the Greeks called it ξανθόν. Seneca however (De Ira, iii. 2⁶)
