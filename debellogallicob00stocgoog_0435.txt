men in aiding tbe Eburones, and to beg that their territories might
therefore be spared. The request was granted on condition that
they delivered up all Eburonian fugitives.

The work of revenge was now to begin As his headquarters in
the scheme of devastation he meditated Caesar chose Aduatuca,
the very place where Sabinus and Cotta had pitched their ill-iared
camp the year before The omens, it might be thought, were
against this selection, but Caesar had his reasons. Aduatuca was
a stronghold, it wasa central point in the territory of the Eburones,
and the Roman worlrs of the previous year could still be utilised
for defence All the baggnge of the army was deposited here, and
Quintus Cicero was left in charge of it with the fourteenth legion,
one of those levied at the beginning of the year, and aoo cavalry.
The nine remaining legions were divided equally between Caesar
himself, Labienus, and Trebonius. Of these Labienus went north·

day since the departure of Caesar, and this was also the day on
which a fresh supply of com ought to be served out to the soldiers
who remained on garrison duty. There were tempting com-lands
in the vicinity, separated from the camp only by a single hill.
Cicero, who up to now had carefully kept his men within camp, at

length yielded to their clamours, and allowed bnlf his legion of
raw recruits to go out to forage. They were accompanied by
a large body of camp-followers and by some 30⁰ veternus, who had
been left in garrison as invalida, but had recovered within the
last few days. Now it so happened that προσ horsemen of the
Sugambri, the German tribe who bad sheltered the Usipetes and
