62 CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

shore oi the Hellespont, and they were tantalized by the daily
sight ol Asia across the uarrow strip ol water. A new quarrel
brolte out at this point, in consequence oi which Leonorius with
the bullr of the army went back to Byzantium. Lutarius how·
ever seized two decked vessels and three boats belonging to
some Macedonian ambassadors, and by plying them across the
strait night and day succeeded in transporting the whole oi his
force. Not long afterwards leonorius (Str. xii 5, § r) also
crossed from Byzantium with the aid of Nicomedes, iring ol
Bithynia The two chieltains now reunited their forces, and
served under Nicomedes against bis brother Zyboetas, whom
they dispossessed os his portion of the kingdom. After this the
Gauls had a high time ol it in Asia. It was as though a pacit
oi wolves had obtained entrance into a sheepfold. Not more
than ro,ooo out oi the ao,ooo were armed, but these sufficed to
terrorise all the inhabitants on this side of the Taurus; besides
which, their numbers in a few generations rapidly increased.
Every people submitted to their exactions‚ even the kings oi
Syria at last paid them tribute, and no prince went to war
without hiring the Gauls, ior sear he should find them hired
against him. Lest they should quarrel among themselves they
wisely agreed to divide the spoil There were three tribes os
them—the Tolistobogii, Trocmi, and Tectosages Ol the
Tolistobogii and Trocmi we lrnow no more than we do of
the Prausi, to whom Brennus is said to have belonged (Str. iv.
p. 188), but the Tectosages had their original home at Toulonse,

being one branch of the Volcae, and were to be found also in ’

Caesar’s time in the Hercynian forest (vi. 24, §i a, 3). To the
Trocmi the shore ol the Hellespont was assigned as tributary,
to the Tolistobogii Aeolia and Ionia, and to the Tectosages the
inland parts. Attalus, iring oi Pergamus (ac. 241-197),was the
first to resist this intolerable domination 3 he drove the Gauls
into the interior, but did not break their power (Paus. i. 8, ξ 2).
Alter this they were confined to the neighbourhood oi the Halys
and Sangarius.
