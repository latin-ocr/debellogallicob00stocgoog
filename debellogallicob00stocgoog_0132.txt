(a) the
shape oi
Britain,

126 CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

regards the breadth however Dio Cassius is pretty accurate,
making it at the greatest agro stades (= 2884 Roman m' )
and at the least 300 (= 37} Roman miles).

As regards the shape of Britain the first idea was that it was
a scalena triangle. We have seen reason to believe that this
was the view oi Pytheas, and it was held by Caesar himself, by
Diodorus Siculus, Strab0‚ and Mela, os whom Diodorus and
Mela compared it to Sicily. Livy however, whose 105th book
is a great loss in this connexion, thought that the shape of
Britain would be better expressed by calling it a rhomboid, and
either he or a later writer named Fabius Rusticus likened it to
the blade oi a battle-axe, upon which Tacitus (Agr. ro) remarks
that this leaves out oi sight the enormous wedge-lile protuber-
ance added to the island hy Caledonia. Tacitus does not tell
us in what direction this wedge projected‚ but perhaps he shared
in the mistaken idea afterwards held by Ptolemy, that Caledonia
bulged out to the east.

The supposed situation os BritaIn has already incidentally
been touched upon. We have seen how Strabo regarded the
south coast ol the island as lying all along the coast os Gaul
from the Rhine to the Pyrenees. He asserta that Kent is
visible from the mouth oi the Rhine ¹. The Pyrenees‚ the
Garonne‚ the Loire‚ the Scine, and the Rhine lay in his view
pretty nearly parallel in a direction irom south to north ⁸.
Hence the lour passages which he tells us were habitually used

. from Gaul to Britain, namely lrom the Rhine, the Seiae, the

Loire‚ and the Garonne (iv. 5, ξ a, p. ¹99) are regarded by him
as being about the saure length. What he says of the length
ol Caesar's passage in one place (ibid.) he extends to the rivers
ol Gaul generally in another (iv. 3, §.g p. 193). In spite ol
Caesar's statement that the passage from Itium was 30 miles
