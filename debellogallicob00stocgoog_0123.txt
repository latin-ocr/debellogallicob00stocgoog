inhabitants extremely peaceable‚ and taught them to navigate
the sca which separated them from the mainland, though the
distance was greater than that to Britain. These last words
are quite out of keeping with the view which would identily the
Cassiterides with the islanda about the Bay oi Vigo ¹.

What then are we to do when dislodged equally from either
hypothesis as to the whereabouts oi these mysterious islanda?
lt seems that we must fall back upon the position ol Herodotus
who did not know that there were any Cassiterides. The
cassiterides in lact were originally only a name whereby the
Greeks sought to satisiy their craving to know whence the
Carthaginians got their tin. As the trade was conducted from
Gadeira, they were naturally associated with Spain: but the
coast of Spain is very bareos islands, and it was difficult to
accommodate thern there. Hence Strabo sends them out to sea,
and modern geographers have unul lately relegated them to the
Scilly Isles Like the island os Delos before it was chained, the
Cassitendes floated at will: tbe name was amoving name like
that ns Thule. To attempt to localise it is as vain a task as to
hunt for Panchaia or for the kingdom oi Prester John.

Still the Phoenicians must have got their tin from somewbere3 Did the
andis they got any of it from tbe British Isles, it would account gfff-ade
ior the persistent connexion oi eilande with the trade. Is there wtth
then any evidence to show that the Phoenicians either oantaint
Gadeira or Carthege ever traded with the British Isles? The
chiet witness, it must be consessed, is a very sbaky one, being
Rufus Festus Avienus, a most confused and conlirsing writer ol

too much work on hle hands to allow oi his taking strip to the Bayoi
Vigo, much less to the Scilly Irles (which is Mt. Bunburys own sup
position). Resides he must hare gone either with Caesar& orders or
without. ln either case we should have heard oi the matter.
