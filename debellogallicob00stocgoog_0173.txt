land. At the same time he says thatin peace there was no
common magistracy, but that justice was administered in the
several districts and cantone (paga) by the local authorities
(vi. 23, ς 5). We are therefore led to conclude that it was
these‘principes regionum atque pagorum'in theirassembly l‘cum
una coierunt,' vi. aa, 5 2), who constituted the governing power
in the states described by Caesar: sor governing power there
must have been to effect the arrangement that one-hall oi
the male population should stay at home every year to cultivate
the ground, and the other hall go out to war (iv. r, 554, 5).
This loose organisation sufficed lor their needs in timens peace:
but in war a more stringent discipline was required, and officers

were then chosen who could say, like Agamemnon in Aristode's
Homer (Pol. iii. 14, 5 5)—

This is all that we leam from Caesar: but, when we tum to

We'find not only sree states controlled by councils, asin

from the most limited monarchy to a real power, which however
always seli short of being despotic (G. 44, ξ ι). Caesar's
description therefore is only a partia} one. It is as though one
were to taire the constitution ol a single country, say that oi
Great Britain, as representative os Europe generally. ‘The
kings’ Tacitus tells us, ‘were chosen frotn their nobility, but
leaders (duces) lronr their valour' (G. Μ ¹i Whether these
kings and leaders were in the same state he does not explain.
But he seems purposely to contradict Caesar by denying that

the leaders in war had power of lile and death or even to flog
or imprison. These penalties could only be inflicted hythe
priests, who were supposed to act under the sanction ol the
God ol Battles, whose symbols they bore into the held from
the sacred groves where they were wont to hang (G, 7, 5 2).
The priests too, we read, were armed with power to procure
silence in the national assemblies (G. rt, 5 4). In some
