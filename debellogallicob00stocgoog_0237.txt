a speech by ssying that, if no one else would follow him, he would
go with only the loth legion, about which he had no doubt, restored
all ranks to a rivalry of trust and devotion. Seven days’ continuous
marching, which included a detour os fifty miles so asto keep in
the open country, brought Caesar’s army within twenty-four miles
of Ariovistus and his forces. 'rhe German chief, consistently
enough, offered to renew negotiationis now that Caesar had come
to him. This offer was not refused, although it was coupled with
the embarrassing condition that none but cavalry soldiers should
accompany the commandere to the conference. Caesar’s cavalry
with the exception of the officers were all Gauls, to whom he did
not dare to confide his safety3 so he kept the condition in the

Ariovistus now endeavoured to cut off Caesar from the supplies
which were being brought up to him from the Sequani and Aedui

five days the two armies lay t'acing one another, coutending only
in cavalry skirmishes, until Caesar found it necessary to restore
communication with his base by establishing a second camp about
600 paces from that of the Germans. This led to some severe
fighting, but even now Ariovistus did not seem inclined for
a general engagement. On inquiring from captives the reason for
this hesitation Caesar discovered that the wise women among the
Germans had declared that they would not be victorious, if they
fought before the new moon. N ext day accordingly the Roman
general forced an engagement upon them, and atter a tiercely
