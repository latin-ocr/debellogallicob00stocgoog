There were other standards besides the engle, which areother

one oi these was called ‘signifer' (ii πῶς 1: C. iii 74‚§ 1).
It is plain from the former ol these passages¹ that each cohort
had its own standard¹. At the same time there are passages
where ‘signum' must be understood oi the standard nithe
maniple’. It is possible that the separate standard lor the cohort
only came in with the Marian organisation. We may notice
that the term used hy Polybius lor standard-hearers is σημοωφόροι
(ri. 24, 56), and that annuli is his word both sor ⁴ maniplc' and
ior ‘standard' (ii. 32, i 6). When Caesar (C. iii-99, ξ 4) tells
us that aster Pharsalia there were brought iu to him 180 ‘ signa
militaria' and mne engles, rt is impossible to confine the lormer
to the standards os cohorte.

A* signum' wasa grewen image oi some kind, and must be Frage
distinguished srom ‘vexillum' which was more like a flag.
When the soldiers saw a red ‘vexillum' hoisted over the
geneum tent, they knew that they must rush to arms (ii ao,
iria). Another hindei vexillum' isdescribcd by Dio Cassius
(xl. 18, ς 3) as inscribed with purple letters indicatiug the army
and the general. This rs in connexion with the ill-sated Parthian
expedition oi Crassus (nc. 53), and so we may suppose that
such dags were in Caesar’s camp also. Dio Cassius speaks

A body ol meu under a special commander, who did not
belong to the force with which they were sarving, would have
a ‘vexillum' sor their eusign Thus the 300 convalescent
