adversaries (B.G.i.12,§6; 14,§5:v.aa,§6). The writer
of the Bellum Africanum speaks of the special favour of the
Gods towards Caesar frgi 3), and mentions divine service
after the battle of Thapsus (86, i 4). But though Caesar was
willing to be helped by religion, he was very unwilling to be
tbwarted by it. Like Claudius in the first Punic War and
Flaminius in tbe second, he was not theman to be deterred by
omens (Suet. J. C. 59, 77, 81), but, unlilre those commanders,
be succeeded in spite of them, until his day of doom came.
As Caesar claimed to be descended from the Gods, heishardly
likely to have professed opinions that were derogatory to them.
In his laudation on his aunt Julia, delivered in bis quaestorship
(Suet J. C. 6), after pointing out that his family were descended
on the motberss side from Ancus Martius and on tbe father's
from Venus, be went on to say, ‘There is therefore in her race
the divinity of kings, whose power is greatest among men, and
the holiness of the Gods, in whose power are kings themselves?
‘l'he motive of this language is pretty obvious, but the language
itself is certainly not that of the Epicurean Josephus (Ant
xviii r, l 4) tells us that when the Sadducees came into power
they bad to conform to the doctrines of the Pharisees, else the
people would not have put up with them. ln the same way we
may suppose that the Epicurean philosophy would not have
gone down with the multitude, who are generally more devout
than their rulers

But whatever Caesare religious convictions may have been, &ueta ,

himself He was certainly gifted with more than his due share
of that ‘absurd presumption iu their own good fortune,’ of
which Adam Smith speaks as characteristic of tbe greater part
ofmen. Heprided himselfupon his ‘ felicitas' (see i. 4o,§ 13 n;
53, l 6: iv. 26, ξ 5), and looked upon success as a debt that
was due to him. ‘Yon are carrying Caesar and his fortune'
hits off this feature of his character, though the anecdote is
probably mythical (Plut Caes. 383 Lucan v. 577, bc).
