Cornwali has been thrown in besides, which may have been
regarded as simplya larger island belonging to the same group ¹.
Hence our historias of England are wout to begin with
a reference to the Cassiteridea Yet this view, suangc to say,
would bave surprised the ancient writers, from whom we
suppose ourselves to have derived it. Diodorus Siculus
(v. 38, ξ 4), after describing the Cassiteridas as lyirrg' off the
coast of Spain, above the country of the Lusitani, goes on to
say that a great deal of tin was also brought from Britain to
Ganl, and thence conveyed hyan overland route to Massilia
and Narbo. That Diodorus is here following Posidonius may
be regarded as certain from the coincidence of his language and
of the sequence of thought with that of Strabo (iii p. 147),
who is confesscdly doing so. According to Strabo in another
passage (iii. p. 175) the Cassiterides are ten in number, and lie
near one another out to sea to the north of the harbour of the
Artabri. If he says in another place (ii. p. rao) that they are
somewhere in the latitude of Britain, that is only part of the
general error which made him imagine the western parts of
Britain to lie opposite the Pyrenees. Mela, himselfa Spaniard,
treats of these islands under Spain, putting them off the country
of the Celtic tribes, among whom he rechons the Artabri ¹.
Pliny (iv. ξ 119) follows suit in saying that the Cassiterides are
off Celtiberia ⁸. Iastly Ptolemy (ii. 6, l 76), treating them under
