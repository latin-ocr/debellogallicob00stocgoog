58 CAESAR'S GALHC WAR

This triumph marks the close ol another chapter in the
struggle between Roman aud cett Hereaster there will be no
serium war with the Cisalpine Gauls, only the suppression of
an occasional revolt while the Romans are engaged in consoli·

gression dating their conquesta. But just atthis point of time the Romans
affilas, come into contact with another section oi the widespread Celtic
ι, 58-65. racc in a different quarter os the globe. We must allow ourselves
a brief digression frorn the main subject in order to see how it

came to pass that the Romans encountered Gauls in Asia.
· ‘c It would be a great mistalte to suppose that in the centur-ies
”enee before Christ the Gauls were confined to France and Italy. On
iffi& the west they overdowed into Spain, and on the east they spread
tde far along the valley oi the Danube. Apart from the direct
‘ testimony of historiens, the philologist can inter this extensive
diffusion of the Celtic racc from the ancient names of places.

Just as we can argue to a Roman occupatiori ol Britain intimes

past irom the many names oi places that end in -chester, -cester,

and the other disguises oi castra, so we can affirm that the

Gauls must have resided sor some considerable time in countries

where we find place-names ending in dunum, -briga, and other

unmistalreably Celtic terminatione The broad fact of an oocu-
pation by Gauls of portions oi eastern Europe is incontestable,
but as to the exact how and when oi their movements our

evidence is confused and conflicting.
expedi- Pausanias, writing from the point of view of invasions ol
ffifflh‘ Greece, says that the first expedition made by the Celts beyond
· t their own borders was under the leadership of Cambaules. He
μ’ does not say where these borders were, and in one passage
defici} and (x. ao, ξ 3) seems to imply that they were on the Ocean, but let
mim us suppose thern to have been somewhere iu Pannonia, where
we lruow that the Gauls were settled sor along time (Justin. xxiv.
4, §5 3-5). In this first expedition they adranced as iar as
Thrace, but the smallness of their numbers made it advisable
sor them to return. This trial-trip however had wbetted their

appetite ior plunder. So not long after they set out again
