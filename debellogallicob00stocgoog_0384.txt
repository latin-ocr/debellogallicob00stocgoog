Treveri, who were contumacious enough not to come to his
councila There were two claimants for power in that tube,
Indutiomarus and his son-in-tav Cingetorix. The lauet at unce
tendered his submission; the former at first meditated resistance,
but, finding himself insufficiently supported by the nobles, made
a forced mrrender, and was converted into a mortal enemy by
caesari preference for his rival

On returning to Boulogne Caesar found all the ships assembled,
with the exception uf sixty, which had been built on the Seiae,
and which had been dn'veu back by contrary winda The Gallie
cavalry were there besides to the numberof nouo, andalsothe chiefs
from all the states, most of whom Caesar was determined to bring
with him as hostages to prevent a rising in Gaul. Among the rest
was Dumnorix, who was extremely unwilling to go Twenty-five
days did Caesar wait while the wind was settled in the north-west.
At last it blew fair, but at the moment of embarlration Dumnorix
rude off with the Aeduau cavalry. Caesar stopped the prooeedings

and sent a large force in pursuit of him with orders to lriil him, if
he resisted. He did resist, and the orders were carried out. Tm

Aeduan mvmry returned to Caesar.

Leaving Labienus in charge on the Continent with three legions
and προσ horse, Caesar now embarked five legions and the other
half of the cavalry un board the lieet, and set sail at sundown with
a gentle brerae from the south-west. During the night the wind
dropped and the ships were carried from their course by the tide,
so that in the morning Britain was tube seen on the leli. The
tide however now turned in Caesar’s favour, and by dint of hard
rowing the ships were got to the old landing·place about mid-day.
The landing was this time unopposed.

Consigning the fleet to the care of Quintus Atrius, who was

left with ten cohorts and 300 horse, Caesar set out by night and
marched twelve miles to the spot where, as he had been informed
by captives, the enemy were collected. Their cavalry and war·
cbariots attempted resistance from the high ground on the far
bank of a stream, but were dislodged by the Roman horse and
took refuge iu a woodland fortress formed uf a barricade of timber.
