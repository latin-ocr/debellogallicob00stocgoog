only what we should call a ‘stafi' Their number was not
fixed. The ontside limit would seem to have been attained
by Pompey in the Mithridatio war, when he was assigned
twenty-five legati ¹. Caesar at first had five (i. 52, 5 ι n.); alter·
wards the number was raised to ten bya decree oi the Senate,
which was supported by Cicero (Prov. Cous. 5 ι8; Balb 5 61).
This was in nc. 56, the year beiore that in which Caesar's
command in Gaul was prolonged lor a second periodos five
years. of Caesar's first batch of five lientenants we know
definitely the names of four. They were Labienus (i. ιι,
5ι n.: ii. 11, 5 3), Q. Titurius Sabinus (ii. 5, 5 6),
L. Aurunculeius Cotta (ii. rr, 5 3), Q. Pedius (ii. ι, 5 ι).
The fifth was probably Servius Galba (iii 1, 5 ι), an officer os
age and experiente. Publius Crassus when first mentioned
(i. 5a,§ 7) is said to have been in command ol the cavalry.
Alrerwards we find him employed as a lientenant (ii. 34, 5 r:
iii. ι,5 ι ; ιι,5 3), but he is nowhere given the title. Other
officere os whom the term ‘legatus' is definitely used are
P. Sulpicius Rufius (iv. ιι, 5 6), C. Fabius (v. ι4,5 ι), L Munatius
Plancus and C. Trebonius (v. ι4, 5 3), Μ. Silanus, C. Antistius
Reginus, and T. Sextius (vi. 1, 5 ι), Q. Fufius Calenus (viii. 39,
5 4) and P. Vatinius (viii. 46, 5 6). These with the former five
make sourteen in all. li we subtract Cotta and Sabinus, who
were killed, and Pedius and Galba, who were respectively
aedile and praetor in 54 nc, we have exactly ten left. Out of
dre first batch Labienus was the only one who survived to the
end. He was Caesar's second in command and had a special
'title (i ιι, 5 an), which marked him out from the rest, and
perhaps made him rank above the quaestor.

Cacsar had very decided notions of his own as to the duties
of lieutenants and their relation to the commender-inchies.
They were bound by orders, and must err on the side ol
