mantal sear. The last is the same boundary that now separates
the Teuton from the Slav. Thus the Germany oi the hncients
was a much larger country than the German Empire ol today.
It included all that, with the exception of the left bank oi the
Rhine, but it contained besides most of Holland, the whole oi
Denmark, the whole of Bohemia, with parts oi Austria,
Hungary‚ and Poland. To these we must add the southern
extremity of Sweden, which alone was known to the Ancients,
and which was universally regarded by thern as an island in
the Sinus Codanus or Baltic Sea. This mistake was natural
enough, since even the redoubtable Pytheas himself had not
sailed iar enough to know that the vast promontory oi Sweden
and Norway was connected with Europe by land at the north.
The supposed island is called by Pliny Scatinauia (iv, 5 96)
or Scadinavia (vlint 39: cp. Mela iii. 5 54), and by Ptolemy
(ii. 11, ξ 35) Scandia3 Tacitus (G. 44,§ a) speaks of it under
the name ol Suionum crhtlales.

The size of this vast and illdefined country was naturally Size
matter oi much disputa. The extreme estimates were on the
one hand that of some writers, both Greek and Roman, who
made the sea-coast of Germany to be 25‚0oo miles, and on the
other that oi Agrippa, who put the whole length oi Germany
along with Raetia and Noricum at 686 miles and the breadth
at 248, on which Pliny remarks that the breadth assigned was
less than that oi Raetia alone, though he is inclined con·
jecturally to put the coast-line at something like Agrippa's
estimate of the length. The extreme length ol the present
German Empire is rechoned at 740 miles, and its extreme
breadth at 580.

Pliny tells us (Μ ¹⁶7) that the Northem Ocean was Imperfect

Romans. Even at the best oi times the more disant parts
