150 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

follows that this was the Thule oi Pytheas or Tyle oi Pliny,
which is spoken olas within a day's sailof the Frozen Sea

Between Ireland and Britain Pliny interposes not only Mona,
but Monapia, Riginia‚ Vectis, Silumnus, and Andros. His
Mona may perhaps be Anglemy, lilre that oi Tacinrs, and
his Monapia Caesar’s Mona or the Isle oi Man. With regard
to Vectis his mistake is plain. That is the Isle oi Wight
(οὒηιτίς), which Ptolemy (ii. 3, § 33) tells us lies under the
Great Harbour. This must not be confused with the island
of lctis already spoken of. Below Britain, says Pliny, lie
Sambis and Axanthos. The last is no doubt the same as
Axantis >or Ushant¹. Pliny gives a wide range to the British
Iales, as he goes on to mention the Glaesiae or Electrides,
which are the amber islanda in the German Ocean. His
statement that none oi these lesser islanda exceeds 1²5 miles
in circumference is true, except of Lewis and Harris, the
largest oi the Hebrides.
