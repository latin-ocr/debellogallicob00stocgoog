124 C IULII CAESARIS

charge of the port. Eighty merchant-vessels had been pressed for
the transport of the legions, besides which there were a few ships
of war. Eighteen more merchant-vessels were lying wind-bound
in a hasbour eight miles further up the coast. The cavalry were
ordered to embark on these. Meanwhile Caesar and the legions
set sail at midnight with a fair wind About nine or ten o'clock
next morning he was lying under the beetling cliffs of Britain, which
were lined with the armed forces of the enemy. Caesar and his
offioers had come in the ships of war. While the heavier transport
vessels were assembling, Caesar employed the time in laying
before his officers his proposed plan of operatione, and exhorting
them to promptitude in the execution. To attempt a landing

But the misfortunes of the Romans did not end here. Tbat
night the moon was at the full and the tide filled the ships of war
which were hauled upon the beach and battered the merchant·
vessels which lay at anchor‚ so as to wreclr some and render
others unseaworthy. To add to their difficulties they had no
supplies, since there had been no idea of wintering in Britain

Caesar knew very well that the peace which he had made with
the Britons would not prevent their trying to make an example of
au invadet, if they saw their way to doing it: so he prepared
