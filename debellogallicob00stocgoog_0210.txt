206 CAESAR¹S GALLIC WAR

cantion, rather than os daring, their position being one os trust;
whereas the ‘imperator' was free to consult sor the best ¹.

It seems to have been an innovation os Caesar’s to assign
the charge ol a particular legion to a particular ‘legatus ’3 but
this practice was kept up under the Empire.

The tribunes l‘ tribuni militum ⁹), according to Varro (Ι. L. v.

§ 81), contain in their name a reference to the primitive division

⁸ into three tribes and the original army ol three thousand This
view is at all events supported by their Greek name χιλίαρχοι
(Polyb. vi. 19,§ 1: Acts xxi. 31), and is in heepiug with the title
‘tribunus Celerum' aa that oi the original master oi the horse ¹.

In the Roman army as described by Polybius the tribunes

sonned the nucleus oi the legions. Alter the consuls had been
appointed, sourteen tribunes were chosen from among men who
had served five yearly campaigns, and then ten more from
men who had served ten campaigns. As there were four
legions, this gives six tribunes to each legion. When ’
the manhood ol Rome vere assembled on the Capitol, the

lourteen younger tribunes distributed themselves thas—tour lor
the first legion, three sor the second, lour l'or the third, three
sor the fourth ; then the ten elder ones joined them as follows-
tvo ior the first legion, three ior the second, two for the third,
three for the fourth. Alter this the tribunes proceeded to picit
men in turn in such a way as to make the strength of the
legions as nearly equal as possible. The appointment ol
the tribunes themselves rested partly with the people and partly
with the consuls or dictators (Polyb. vi. 12, i 6 ; 19, ὁ 7:
Liv. ix. 30, 5 3).
