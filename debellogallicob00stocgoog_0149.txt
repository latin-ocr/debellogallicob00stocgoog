in the Belgian names ol British tribes. Caesar has not himself
recorded any of these names, but we find mention in Ptolemy
Of ’Δτροβότιοι (ἰί. 3, ξ 26) and oiBr'hynt (ib. ξ 28), both os them
south os the Thames, andos neptem (ξ 17) north'ol the
Humber. We may also recall to mind in this connexion our
author's statement that Divitiacus, the king oi the Suessiones,
had in a period which be describes as ‘within our own memory'
extended his sway over Britain (ii. 4, ξ 7).

Diodonrs speaks oi the races which inhahited Britain as
‘autochthonous’ without attempting any distinction. The land
was untouched, he says, by foreign invasion, and neither
Bacchus nor Hercules nor any ol the heroes was reported
to have made an expedition against it.

Tacitus throws a greater air ol scienoe into his speculatione
on this point The red hair and large limbs oi the Caledonians
he thinks indicative oi a German origin, whereas the swarthy
complexione of the Silures (South Wales), the prevalence
among them os curly hair, and the vieinity oi Spain argue an
early iberian settlement in this part oi Britain. The parts
nearest to Gaul he thinks it reasonable to suppose were peopled
from that country, and in support ol this conclusion he adduces
the similarity that could be observed between Gauls and
Britons in religion, language, and character.

We need not pay much attention to Tacinrs' suggestion os
an ethnologieal affinity between the Caledonians and Germana.
As to his idea of an immigration direct from Spain, it is founded
on a geographical blunder. Tacitus shared in Strabo’s error

that‘the west of Britain lay quite close to Spain. Neither os
them thought os Gaul as having, properly speaking, a west
coastat all, hut imagined the ocean-board as sloping continu·
ously from the Rhine to the Pyrenees ¹. With these abste-

¹ This conception appears also in the Aristotelian De Mundo. The
writer ol that treatise says (3, t ιι) os the ocean—Eira κατ’ ὀλίγον help
τοὺς Σκύθας re nol Κελτικὴν σφίγγει τὴν οἱκαυμένην, πρός re τὸν Γαλατικὸν
κόλπον sol τὰς προαιρημόνας Ἡρακλείους στήλας.
