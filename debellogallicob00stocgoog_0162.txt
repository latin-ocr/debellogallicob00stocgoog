tion is rendered easier by the fact that even at the p nt day
some oi the most important German towns are little m thau
clearings in the woods

The account given by Pliny (xvi 55 5, 6) of the ι’ eoi the
' trees-and Pliny, we must remember, had hims lfbeen iu
Germany-is like what Stanley had to tell ns o the virgin
foresta of Cenual Africa The gnarled and entan ed roots of
these giants of the forest would raiae hilis when vered with
earth, or, where the earth failed to follow them, ould leave
arches through which squadrons of horse might .
oaks clung with a savage tenacity of life to the gr und, inso-
much that some which grew around the lakes, when dermined
by the vaters or dislodged by the vinds, would fioa away on
great islands of earth, and sometimes bear down at ni ht on the
Roman galleys, that suddenly found themselves engaged in
unaval battle with their branches. Pliny says that the forests
covered all Germany, adding darkness to cold, with the exception
of the country oi the Chauci, which was bare even of bushes.

Of the great rivers of Germany only the Rhine and Danube
(vi. 25, 5 ι)ι are mentioned hy Caesar. The Mans (Mosa) and

' Schelde (Scaldis vi. 33, 5 3) are to him Gallie rivers, flowing as

they do westward of the Rhine. The Main (Moenis) and
Lippe (Lupia) are mentioned hy Mela (iii. 5 3ο) as tributaries of
the Rhine, and the Ems, Weser, and Elbe (Amissis, Visurgis,
Albis) as flowing into the Ocean. He speaks also (iii. 5 33) of
the Vistula as forming the boundary between Germany and
Sarmatia Pliny (iv.§1oo) adds nothing to this list, except
the Guthalus, which is otherwise unknown. Strabo (vii. r, 5 3)
is alone in mentioning the Saale (Σάλας), which becanoe known
through the death near it of the elder Drusus in the midst oi his
victorious campaign. Tacitus (G. 41, 5 a) speaks of the Elbe
as known no longer in his day except by hearsay. By that

time the flood ol Roman aggression had been repelled hythe
