SUMMARY.

⁸ Tun third book contains four episodes-the attack on Servius
Galba, the war with the Armoricans, the campaign of Crassus in

Aquitania, and the expedition against the Morini and Menapii.
Of these the second is the most important and is recounted at the
greatest length. The first really belongs to the campaign of
the preceding year (tac 57). Its inclusion in the third book gives
us ground for believing that the Commentaries were composed
year by year. For Caesar evidently postponed the narration of
it until he could obtain full information after rejoining his army in
the spring of 56. Caesar deemed it of imponance to Roman com·
merce to keep open the pass over the Great St. Bernard ¹. To this
end, when he was leaving for ltaly, he sent Servius Galba, who had
already seen service against the Allobroges, into tbe Vallis Poenina
(le Valais) in command of the twelfth legion and some of the
cavalry. Galba had instructions to winter, if he deemed it expe·
dient, among the tribes which dwelt here on the upper course of
the thne before it flovs into the Lake of Geneva After some
successful operations Galba posted two cohorts in the territory of
the Nantuates, whom M. Desjardius places near villeneuve, and
