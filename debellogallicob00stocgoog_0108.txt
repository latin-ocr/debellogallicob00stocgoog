102 CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

called ‘the sagum,' which was buekled in solda on his person.
This last garment was also worn hythe Spaniards (App. vi μ,
adsta). The Romans too assumed it, but only when there
was a call to arms, whereas with the Gauls it was habitur-1¹.
lt was the colours however which the Gaul indulged in that
startled the Greek and Roman observet, his staring stripea
and the brilliancy oi his cbeekered tartan3 his garments too,
ii be were oi superior rank, would be sometimes bespangled
with gold. This barbaric taste sor bedirenment displayed itseli
also in the wearing oi golden ornaments hythe men as well as
by the women. Nothing is more distinctiva of the Gaul than
his‘torques' oi solid gold3 and he would wearalso bracelets and
armlets of the same metal, as well as large rings, and in war
sometimes a golden breastplate (D. S. v. 27, ξ 33 Str. iv. 4, 55).
The attention bestowed upon their personal appearance hythe
women is commented upon favourably by Ammianus, who says
that in Gaul, and especially in Aquitania, you would never see
even tbe poorest woman in rags, as you might in other countries
(A. Μ. xv. ra, ξ a).

The mode os wearing the hair among the Gauls was peculiar.
They smeared it continually with a decoction oi chalk (τίωνοσ,
D. S. v. 28, 5 1), and drew it back off the temples towards the
crown oi the head and the hind part oi the neck, which immrted
to their iaces an appearance suggestive oi Satyrs It was this
lashion, we may suppose, which gave rise to the name Gallia
Comata. The effect oi the wash used on the bair was to make
it as thick as horsehair. Some oi them shaved their chin, others
bad moderate beards; the nobles wore no whiskers, but grew
long moustaches, which embarrassed them at table.

The habits ol the Gauls at meals are described by Posidonius
⁸ from personalobservation. They did not recline like the Romus,
nor sit on chairs, butsquatted on the ground on hey mattresses'.
The iood was served up on low wooden rables. They ate little
