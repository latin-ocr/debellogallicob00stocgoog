Commius by making him king over his own countrymen the
Atrebates (ts. 21, ᾖ 7), and subjecting the Morini also to his
sway (vii. 76, § ι). If we knew a little more about the matter,
we might be able to distinguish more clearly between the

dealing also with the religion of Gaul, with some notice ol
