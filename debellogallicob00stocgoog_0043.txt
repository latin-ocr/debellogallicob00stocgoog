cnarrcren or caesare 19

Caesar was a vietim to two passions, love and ambition; but Ambinon.
in him ambition overmastered love. He claimed desceut from
Venus, and he worshipped at the shrine oi Minerva; but, for
all that, it he had been Paris, the epple would have fallen to

Juno. lt is not necessary for ns here to enter into the scau·

In other respecu than this he is admitted even by his enemies
to have been temperate. He did not warm his valour with wine
like Alexander, and he was indifferent to the pleasures oi the
table. Cato bitterly said of him that ‘he alone came sober to
the overthrow oi the commonwealth' (Quint viii. a, ξ 9; Suet.
J. C. 53). Caesar was in fact the most deliberately ambitious
man that ever lived. From the first he was determined to be
second to noue. It was this great vice nat swamped his many
virtues. He had ever in hie mouth the lines of Euripides, which
Cioero bas thus rendered—

‘Nam ti violandum est ius, regnandi gratia

Violandum est: aliia rebus pietatem colus¹.'

ll you would only let Caesar be a despot, he would be as
benevolent a despot as you could find, but a despot he must be.
This was the aim and obJect oi his life, and the good that he
did was incidental. For thisbe was ready to scheme from his
youth up, and to gain this end he ultimately deluged the world
with blood. The stories told by Plutarch about the Alpine
village and Caesar's teara over Alexander (Plut. Caes. 113 ep.
Suet. J. C. 7) are typical, is not true. They sufficiently indicate
the impression left by Caesar upon the age that followed him.
So does the vast scheme of conquest which he is credited with
having entertained before his death (Plut Caes. 58), when the
world of Rome was already at his feet. It was by playing upon
his ambition that Decimus Brutus lured him to his doom (Plut.
emh). ·
