Equally prompt was the sunender of the Ambiori, to whom
Caesar next went on.

The Nervii alone threatened resistance. They were accounted
the most savage among their own counnymen, and ,they were also
the most distant, their territory extending up to Bnrxelles After
three days’ march through their country Caesar ascertained from
captives that the river Sambre (Sabis) was not more than ten
miles off, and that on the fat side of it all the Nervii were waiting
