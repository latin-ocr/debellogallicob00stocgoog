168 CAESAR'S canuc WAR

remarking that the only difference in dress between the men
and women among the Germana was that the latter more often
wore linen garments. According to Tacitus the usual dress oi
the men was the sagum, fastened with a brooch or, iailing that,
a thorn ¹. He distinctly asserta that they wore nothing more,
at least indoors in their own inglenooks. It was only the very
rich who were distinguished by what a Roman would regard as
clothing ¹, and this, adds the historiari, was not loose, like that
oi the Sarmatiam and Parthians, but tight·litting and such as to
display the limbs. Still, even in the time os Tacitus the
primitive garments oi wild beaste' skins were to be seen. Those
who dwelt near the Roman border, where they were worn
probably only from poverty, were clad rather than dressed in
them; but the more distant tribes expended ali the resources oi
savage dandyism in varying their mandes of hide by sewing on
patches oi what we may suppose to be sealskin

The scanty clothing of the Germana, notwithstanding the
rigour of their elimate, combined with their habit of bathing in
rivers (iv. r, i 103 vi. ar, §i 3, 5), gave the southern nations
an impression oi great hardihood Mela notices their fondness
sor swimming¹. This was specially characteristic oi the
Batavians, whose position gave them plenty oi opportunities sor
practising the art‘. But though the Germana could endure
cold and want, they vere like the Gauls in their inability to bear
beat ; like them also, their strength in the field lay rather in
a sudden rusb than in a steady endurance os the strecs and toil

of battle (Tac. G. 4, ξ 3). ¹
With regard to the government oi the Germana Caesar has
