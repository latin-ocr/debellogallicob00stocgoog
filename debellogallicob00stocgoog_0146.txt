142 cAESAR’s GALLIC WAR

from Posidonius ¹. Hence it has been inserted that the informa·
tion about Britain also is taken from Posidonius, and that that
philosopher had himself visited our island. But this inference
is precarious‚ so long as there is no other evidence to show that
Posidonius ever was in Britain. We must therefore loolr for
another source, which we seem to find in Pytheas lt is no
very violent supposition that the island Mictis, to which Timaeus
says that the Britons sailed in their coracles, is the same as the
island Ictis’. Mictis, as we have already scen, is said by
Timaeus to have been the island from which the tin came;
lctis is spoken of as that to which it was brought. The six
days' voyage is described by the historian in some phrase which
Pliny renders by the word ‘introrsum’ This can hardly mean
anything buta voyage along the coast. Where then was the
island of lctis? This question seems now to have answered
itsell. Supposing the Britons to start on their voyage from the
partos the island nearest to Gaul, it would take them about
aweelr to get down to St. Michael's Mount in Comwall‚ which

the description of lctis irresistibly suggests. We conclude then,
as on the whole most probable‚ that the account given by
Diodorus of the British tin-trade comes from Pytheas, and that
the island of lctis or Mictis is St Michael’s Mount⁸.

here and of subject in the immediate seqnel both point to Posidonius being
the author whom Diodorus had before him in this particular context.

it iu the text of the one passage where it is mentioned (Plin. N. H. iv.
t 104).

¹ The Rew. Henry Fumeaux suggests that the description of St, Michael's
Mount is due merely to its having been ewen then the distinguishing feature
of the place, and that the tin was really shipped from more convenient
harbours in Mount’s Bay, such as Pennanee, Newlyn, Mousehole, Maraziou.
