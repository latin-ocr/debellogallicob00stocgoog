But ii the Romans were disappointed in the pearls oi Britain,
they were compensated by the excellence oi the mollusc that
produced them. The oysters oi Britain became famous under
the Empire‚ and were held to surpass in flavour even those ol
the Lucrine lake. Everyone will remember the gourmand in
Juvenal (Sat iv. ¹40·²)› who was skilled to detect at the first bite
whether a given oyster was a native of Circeii or came from
a bottom at Richborough. Mucianus, who was the greatest
authority oi his age on this subJ'ect, could only find one oyster
which he considered sweeter than the British, namely, that
which came from Cyzicus (Plin. N. H. ix. ξ 1693 xxxii. § 62).

by the South Britons as pets, but they considered it contrary to
sound religion to eat them (r. ra, 5 6). Probably the Romans
taught thern to overcome these prejudices, as the cheneroth,
which Pliny speaks of as a kind oi goose, cameto be regarded
in Britain as a great delicacy ¹. The aversion from hare's flesh
lingers among the peasantry of lreland to the present day.

marhet, was erroneoosly considered by some people to have its
origin in Britain. This was the mysterious zimber, which came
from no one exactly knew where. AGreek named Sotacus was

xxxvii. ξ 35).
