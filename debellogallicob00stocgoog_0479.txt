the bodies of those who were unable to bear arms. At last, how·
ever, the longed·for relief arrived, consisting, if we may credit ’
Caesar's statement, of 8,ooo horse and about asoooo foot. This
vast host was commanded by Commius, king of the Atrebates,
once Caesare most faithful servant, by Viridomarus aud Epore-
dorix the Aeduaus, and by Vercassivellaunus, a cousin of Vercinge-
torix. On they came in their pride, thinking to sweep everything
before them, especially as Caesar would be attached from the
other side by Vercingetorix„ But the Romans moed firm, every

the heigbts, possibly on the slopes of Mont Flavigny. llere
a desperate effert was made hythe besieged to break through.
Caesar sent Labienus with six cohorts to the relief of the two
