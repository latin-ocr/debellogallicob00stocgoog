The intense individualism too which marks the modern
Enghshman has come down to him from the lree German,
who did not live in towns, but at most in straggling hamlets,
where every man's house was separated by a space from his
neighbom (G. 16, §5 r, a), and whose liberty degenerated
into licence when he came in at his own sweet wrll a day or two

vices more easily than hy arms, is unfortunately not without
a parallel in our own manners. lt may be surmised also that
the ‘brutality,’ with which our neighbours reproach us, has

condemns it himself as a ‘prava pervicacia' (G. 24). But how

brought home to us when we find the name ol Englishman
making its first appearance on the field ol history in the
