intimately connected with the great size oi the Germane was
the lateness oi their physical development and the chastity of
their youth, on which Caesar (vi. ης 4) has commented ¹.

From the homogeneity oi appearance among the Germans
Tacitus inserted a great purity of race. He was inclined to
think them indigenous. ‘Their lays( he says, ‘which are their
only history, celebrate a god Tuisco, who was sprung from
earth, and his son Man, as the origin and founders of their
racel Here we are reminded ol the Druidic teaching that the
Gauls were descended irom Dis paler. The Teutonic Adam
appears under the name ‘Mennor ' in a late mediaeval poem os
Meister Frauenlob‚ which is quoted by Grimm-

‘Mentior der ente was genunt,
dem diutische rede got tet bekanh'

As Adam was taught Hebrew, so was Man taught Dutch.
. People are generally supposed to know their own names best,
and the Germans, it may be noticed, do not call themselves
‘Germaus’ nor yet ‘Aliemands' but Dutch (Deutsch), which
is supposed to mean merely ‘belonging to the people or nation'
But justas the name Allononm' was imposed upon the whole
body owing to the importanceof a particular tribe at aparticular
period, so it would seem to have been with the name Germani
also. The first Teutonic invaders of Gaul, according to Tacitus
(G. a, ξ 5), belonged to a tribe called ‘Germani‚' and the name
spread from them to the whole race ¹. In the historian’s own
time these early settlers were known as Tungri. We may
identiiy them with the ‘Cisrhenane Germans' of Caesar
(ii. 3, § 4; 4, ξ ιο; vi. s, ξ 3), who comprised the Condrusi,
Eburones, Caeroesi‚ and Paemani. Their name survives to the
present day in Tongres.
