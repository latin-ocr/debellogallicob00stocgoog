to Mont Beuvray in 376 Α. 1). We had just sat down to enjoy our
long-deferred bread and cheese, when a kind-looking old gentle-
man, with a long nose and a white heard, advanced to greet us.
In a lew momente we were made welcome to all the hospitality
his roos could offer. The cottage may be described in Pliny's

phrase as a ‘veroni secretumque panotios! A room plain evento
bareness, containing a single bed; on a shell a lew books ; the
walls decorated with paintings sorne ol considerable artistic merit,
others less so; to the right oi the lire-place there were s'uch
amiable inscriptions as the following :-

Fcis bien i tone
N'ettends pes des reconnaissonoes.
Aine tout le monde

The stands which were set under the bottles on the table were
ol Gallie manufacture and dug up at Bibracte ll we had wanted
an egg, there was an egg·eup ready oi the same workmanship.
One ol the designs on the wall portrayed our host in the costume
oi a Gallie swineherd driving a pig to maritet. Another repre·
sented him as pointing a revolver at a w01t; lor there was still
an occasional wolf about the country at the tinie when he began his
researches Another, and very well executed, design represented
a Gallie warrior and his horse. There was also a representation
oi a moonlight effect done by sornebody who had arrived late at
the cottage.

Alter luncheon our host shewed us the camp ol Antony (viii. a),
os which the ‘vallum' is very well marked. He also pointed
out the place where a great Gallie sair used to be held and
where shops had been discovered3 also where the slaughter·
house stood. These things had to be taken on trust, as well as
the statement that a certain rock, to which he brought us, was
the tribunal froin which the Gallie princes used to deliver their
harengues, while the chiels stood hyon the oval platlorm which
surrounded it But there eould be no doubt about the steep
mound, extending, we were told, ior five kilometres and repre·
senting the walls ol the ancient town ol Bibracte.
