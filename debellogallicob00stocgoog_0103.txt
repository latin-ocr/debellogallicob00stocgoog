hurty them into unwise action· Like the Atheniens, they
were always sager after something new (ιν. 5: vii. μ, 5 a).
Caesar describes the common people as gathering round the
merchants in me country towns and forcing news from them
whether they lilred it or not, so that the demand sometimes
mested the supply; the upper classes adopted the more politic
course oi asking the strangers to dinner, and proceediug to
interrogate them afterwards (D. S. v. 28, ς 5).

‘Gentes superbae superstitiosae' is what Mela (iii.§ 18) says os
