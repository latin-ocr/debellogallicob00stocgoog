It is applied to any short composition which is intended
rather for use than for show, such as a skeleton speech ¹,
a lecture note-book (Quint. ii. 11, § 7), official memoranda
(Ltv.vi.1‚§a: Quint viii. a,§rs), or a biographical memoir
(Suet Tib. 61). We have the express authority of Hirtius
(B. G. viii. Prooenn ξ 23 30, ξ 13 48, § ιο) sor its application to
Caesar's books on the Gallie War as well as that os Cioero

(Brut. ᾖ 262). It was also the name given by Gaius to his four
books of Institutes it corresponds in part to the Greek
ἔφημφίι· and inpari to imdyaspyro (Cic. ad Art. ii. 1,§ 2), and may
be rendered by our‘sketoh,' ‘ j0ttings,’ ‘memoranda' or ‘mernoirs'

Caesar then, by the title which he has conferred upon his

work, modestly intimates that he does not regard himself as
writing history, but only as supplying materials sor others
to work up. But, as Cicero has finely said in the Brutus (§ ada)
‘in wishing that others who meant to write history might have
matter at haud to take from, he has perhaps conferred a favour
upon sooIs, who may try to crimp and curl the bare beauty
ol bis style3 but he has deterred men ol sense from writing;
forthere is nothing more delightiui in historical composition
than a plain and luminans brevity'!

Iu one respect the planos writing, even in the Commentaries, The
gives some scope lor the display of that iorce which Quintilian ΨΜ
dwella upon as characteristic ol Caesaffs oratory (Inst. Or. 'n 7,
§342 1.1,§114; οξ 25: xii. 10, ξ rr), and that is in the
speeches. The speeches in ancient writers are not supposed
ιο he genuine. They constitute the hamatic clement in
history. Their rnerit is not ιο say what was actually said,
but to say what was appropriate to the occasion. Thackeray,

1 think, remarks somewhere that he would have made a most

ῐ.

¹ Cp. what Hirtius ssys iu his pressce-‘ Qui (sc commentarii) suot editi,
ue scienda tantarum rerum scriptoribus desit, adeoque probantur omnium
iudicio, ut praerepta, nou praebita neutras scriptoribus rideatur!
