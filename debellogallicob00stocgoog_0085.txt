among the prisonem, and having been violated by a centurion,
contrived to bring his head horne as a present to her husband.

Tolistobogii, and in their camp the Romans possessed them-
selves ofa spoil that had been amassed by years of pillage.
As it was now mid autumn, Manlius marched his victorious
army bach to winter-quartem on the coast. Here he received
enthusiastic messages of congratulation accompanied by presente
oi golden crowns from the various Cistaurine people whom he
had hberated from their standing dread of the Gauls, who were
now forbidden to continue their forays (Liv. xxxviii. 4ο). But
the success of Manlius was by no means so well appreciated
among his own countrymen, by whom his triumph was very
near being disallowed on the ground that he had no mandate
from the Senate and people to wage war upon the Galatians.

and Cremona was introduced into the Senate, to say that those and cte·
colonica were ina bad way. The Senate passed a decreeffiffldos

to emol 6,ooo families for distribution between the colonies3
the praetor who introduced the deputation was also to appoint
three commissioners to carry out the matter. When Laelius
rennned, he obtained the sanction of the Senate to a further
proposal, that two new colonies should be quartered on the
lands that had previously belonged to the Boii. ht the extreme
end of the following year we find this decree partially carried out
by the establishment of the Latin colony at Bononia, which is
now the city of Bologna. The territory on which it stands had
been Etruscan before it became Gallie. Three thousand men
vere quartered there, those among them who were knights
receiving 700 jugera apiece and the rest 500.
