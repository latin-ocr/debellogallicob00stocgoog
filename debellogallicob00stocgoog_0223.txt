rur nouare aaut ιη

ὅσσά, probably an onomatopoetic word representing the ‘hias’
of the weapon ιι it flew through the air, aud is described by
Polybius (wi 23, §io-rr), by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (ν. 46),
by Plutarch (Marius 25), and by Appian (iv. r). Dionysius,
who lived nearest to the time ol Caesar, describes itas con-
sisting of a long and massive shall, from the end of which there
projected ιιι irou spit, not less than three feet long. With tbe
exception os the head tbe spit was os solt immeo as ιο bend
when it had lodged in its mark, and not only trammel the
enemy, but be useless ior return. This describes the general
type oi the weapon ιι seen iu the specimens which have been
preserved to us, but it varied ol course at different periods, and
ewen at the same period all ‘pila' were not alike. Polybius
says that the soldiers carried two-one heavy and oue light,
but that in all 'cases tbe length oi the shaft was 3 cubits
(ab feet), aud the length os the iron the same, only that part
ol it was hidden in the shaft Oi the more massive kind, he
tells us, some had ι round and others a square shall, apalm
(²3 inchesl in diameter or ‘superficies' Such a weapon as
this could hardly he used in ordinary fighting, but it might be
bunched with great effect from ι height, aud ιο may correspoud
ιο what Caesar calls ‘muralia pila' (w. 40, 5 6: vii 82,§ 1).
Up to the time oi Marius the ‘pilum’ was confined to the
‘hastati’ and ‘principes' the ‘triarii' being armed with the
‘hasta' Before the battle of Vercellae Marius is recorded ιο
have devised a means ol still more effectually attaining the
result desired with regard ιο the ‘pilum' Taking out one of
the two iron rivets, with which the shank was attached to the
shast, he inserted instead a wooden peg, which would easily
break and let the weapon hang sideways, thus making it difficult
ιο draw it out (Plut. Mar. 25). Caesar seems to have trusted
to the bending oi the iron ιο produce this bampering effect
upon the soe (i. 25, l 3). The ‘pilum’ bad a spilte ιι the lower
end, ιο that it could be fixed into the mound ¹.
