w CAESAR'S 6ch WAR

Rachle* to say about Caesar's clemency. He set a glorions example

to bis countryrnen, and one which they sorely needed, in the

Bubafim magnanimity which enabled him to forgive the most exasperat·

ing injurios and insults. In the matter oi the Gallie War,
however, it must be consessed that, it we were not told os
Caesar's clemency, we should have difficulty in discovering it
lor ourselves. Barbariana perhaps, mere Gauls and Germana,
were hardly to be counted as within the pale of humanity‚ The
⁶,000 Helvetii who attempted to escape alter their surrender he
had brought back, and, to use his own curt phrase, ‘in hostium
numero habuit! Nothing more is said-sor aiter that there was
nothing moreto say oi them The rest ol the Helvetii he shep-
herded back to their own country, asDiodorus puts it, preferring
their occupancy oi it to that of the Germans, who were pretty sure
to step into their place. The Veneti surrendered to him uncon-
ditionally. He put all their senate to death and sold the rest
into slavery. This was a lesson to them, he tells us, to observo
the rights of ambassadors (B. G, iii. 16, §43 cp. 9,§ 3). But the
Veneti had not seized ambassadors, as Caesar himself did sub
sequently. Their offence was to have retained some oi Caesar’s
officere who were sent to get corn, in the hope oi thereby
recovering their own hostages (iii. 7,§ 3). 800 German cavalry
had dispersed 5,0oo of Caesar’s while negotiations were going
on. When the leaders oi the Usipetes and Tencteri came in
a body to apologiae sor this ‘regrettable incident,' Caesar seized
them, surprised their encampment, and sent his cavalry to cut
down the women and children (iv. 14, § 5). It vas his severity
to Acco that was among the main causes oi bringing about the
great revolt oi Gaul in nc. 52 (cp. vi. 44,§ a, and vii. r, ξ 4).
At the capture of Avaricum his soldiers spared neither age nor
sex (vii. 28, § 43 cp. 47, i 5). For this perhaps Caesar is
hardly to be held responsible, sor the men are not always as
humane as their general, just as the hounds sometimes differ
in their views from the huntsmen. Nor, though it does not ·
exalt our idea oi his humanity‚ is he perhaps to be blamed ior
