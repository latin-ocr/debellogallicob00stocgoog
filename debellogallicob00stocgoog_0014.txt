viii PREFACE

department up to the limits of human possibility-and
beyond them.

An English work deserving of very respectful mention
is Bunburys History of Ancient Geography, which
Ι have to thank Professor Case for lending me

Besides these works, Camden's Britannia, Warde
Fowler’s Julius Caesar, Elton's Origins of English
History, Rhys’s Celtic Britain, F umeaux's Germania of
Tacitus, D’Arbois de Juhainville's Les noms celtiques
chez Cesar et Hirtius, Marquardt’s Staats·Verwaltung‚
and Purser’s article on Exercitus in Smith’s Dictionary
oi Antiquities have all been used with advantage. But
after due acknowledgements have been made to the
moderns, my main debt is still to the ancients‚ whom
I have in every case studied at first hand.

Having indicated the published sources on which
I have drawn most freely, I now wish to return thanks
for private kindness. Mr. Evelyn Abbott, Mr. Warde
Fowler, the Rev. Henry Furneaux, and Professor
Pelham have been at the pains of revising large portions
of the introduction while still in manuscript, and their
suggestions have proved of the greatest value. I have
further to thank Mr. Evelyn Abbott for the loan oi
books bearing on Caesar, one of which, namely the
Caesar-Dictionary of Dr. Otto Eichert‚ has been espe-
cially serviceable. ·Professor Rhys has both supplied
me with direct information on Celtic philology and also
lent me the work of M. D'Arhois de Jubainville. Mr.
Ε. W. Johnson of my own college, who is now Professor
of English at Cheshunt College, has given me the use
of the Emperor Napoleon's work, together with the
magnificent maps and plans which add so much to its
value, and Mr. Herbert Awdry of Wellington College
