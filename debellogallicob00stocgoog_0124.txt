11ss CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

metrical geography, who is assigned to the latter hollos the
fourth century of our era. In his Ora Maritima, a poem in
iambic verse addressed to a youth named Probus, he claime to
have derived part ol his information from the records os the
voyage of Himilco the Carthaginian :-

‘Haec olim Himilco Poenos Oceano super
Spectasse semet et probasse rettulit:
Haec uos, ab imis Punicorum annalibus
Prolata longo tempore, edidimus tibi·
412-415, Wemrdori

This Himilco vas dispatched hythe Carthaginians to explore
the coasts oi Europe at the same time that Hanno vas sent
round Africa. We have no clue to the date of these voyages
beyond me vague words ol Pliny, vrbo says that they toolr place
in the most flourishing times oi Cartbage ¹. Pliny says nothing
as to the distance to which the voyage oi Himilco extended;
nor does Avienus assert that he reached the British Isles, but
only that he came to some islanda called Oestrymnides, which
were rich iu tin and lead. Tvo days' sail from there, the poet
goes on to say, was the Holy lale, inhabited by the Hibernians,
and near that again vas the island oi the Albiones-

‘Propiuqua rursus insula Albionum patet'—112.

The Oestrymnides themselves are declared to have lain in
a bay under a rocky promontory running south, and their
inhabitants are described as a vigorous and proud tace, skilled
in mining, and much devoted to trade, who navigated vast
vvaters in boats made ol skin, whereby we are reminded ol the
coracies used by the Britons. In lact il we were to amalgamate
the tvvo sources oi the tin trade known in Caesar’s time-Spain
and Britain-we should have something corresponding to the
description ol Avienus.

According to Avienus there was a trade Rept up with the
