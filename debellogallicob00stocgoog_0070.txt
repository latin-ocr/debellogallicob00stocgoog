The Genls The Gauls es a whole did join Hannibal, with the single

ffigm exception oi the Cenomani (Liv. xxi. 55, § 4), though those in

Rome and the immediate neighbourhood of the Roman army, between the

carthage Trebia and the Padus, besought the assistance of the Romans
against the foragers whom Hannibal was sending against them
in impatience at their not coming over to him But when the
Gauls realised that the immediate effect of the presence of their
new ahy was, not that they should join, as they expected, in
plunder‚ but that their own territories should be made the seat
of war and he crushed by having to support the armies of both
sides in their winter-quartem, their animosity was turned again
from the Romans against Hannibal. The life of the Cartha·
ginian commander was at this time in such danger that he had
to have recourse to disguise in order to protect himself against
assassination. But the inability to combine, which has always
formed the weakness of the Celts, now proved of service to
Hannibal3 for, when one chieftain laid a plot against him,
it would be betrayed to him by another. lt was this profound
dissatisfaction of the Gauls, whom it was Hannibal's policy to
humour, that suggested his premature attempt to cross the
Apennines and led to his retirement into Liguria after its
failure.

recognising the consul, and shouting out ιΗοΙ here is the
slayer of our countrymenl' put spurs to his horse, charged
at him through the throng‚ and, after first cutting down his
ermom-bearer, pierced him with his lance.
