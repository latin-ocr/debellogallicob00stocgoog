time of writing, there had been no open rupture between
them. Moreover some watemeuts are made in the earlier
books which do not quite tally with those in the later, as
when in ii. 28,§ 1 we are told that the Nervii were reduced
almost to extinction, whereas in v. 38, i 4 we find thern quite
ready to take up arma agaim Sinall discrepandes oi this kind
might easily have been set right, had Caesar been anxious to
adjuat his earlier to his later impressions. They serve rather
to increase than diminish our confidence in him as a writer.

Although fastidiosa in his choice of words, as became one
who was the great grammatica] authority of his day ¹, Caesar
was newertheless a quick writer. Hirtius (Β. G. viii prooem.§ 6)
says that his own admiration ior the Commentaries was greater
than that ol the rest os the world; sor that other people only
knew how well aud correctly they were written, but that he
knew how easily and quickly.

It is now time to turn from the book to the man who wrote it.

¹ Clcero ir alluding to the De Analogia os Caesar when he says (Brut.
ς 261) ⁴ Caesar autem rationem adhibens consuetudinem vitiosam et corrup·
tam pura et incorrupta consuetudine emendat! His usage in grammar is
quoted with respect by Quintilian i 5, §633 and Aulus Gellius ir. 16, 5 8
calls him ‘graula auctor linguae latinae!
