Diodorus (D. S. v. 27, §i 1, ι) describes its rivers as running
with gold. We have already had occasion to notice the extensive
use ol gold in ornaments and the sacred treasures that existed
in various parts os the country. The Gauls had a strange
habit ol committing these treasures ior sale-keepiug to the
lakes. When the Romans got possession ol the country these
lakes were sold hythe state, and the purchasers sometimes
discovered mill-stones ol solid silver. The treasures at Tolosa,
which were saclred by Caepio, are said to have been ol the value
ol 15‚ooo talents ¹. They consisted os unwrought gold and
silver, a lact which, spart from other arguments, is latal to the
idea ol Timagenes that these treasures had beeu brought home
by the Tectosages from Delphi Whenever we read in Livy of
a victory over Gauls, we are pretty sure to be told afterwards
ol the amount of gold and silver that was carried in triumph.
The arms oi the Gauls were richly adorned with these metals,
and when Bituitus (see p. 73) was carried in triumph in Rome,
it was in the silver car in which he had fought (Flor. i. 37, ξ 5).
His father Luernius' had so much money to spare that he once
rode through the plains scattering gold and silver from his car
to the assembled multitudes oi his countrymen. The same
ostentatious monarch enclosed a space oi twelve stades square
in which there were vats filled with costly liquor, and tables
served with iood continuously t'or all cornera during several days.
A minstrel who came too late for the good cheer met the
monarchia his car. He celebrated the royal magnificence and
bewailed his own misiortuue. Bituitus was so pleased that he
called lor a purse ol gold, and flung it to the singer, who picked
it up as he ran beside the car, and then burst into a grateiru
ebant, declaring that the very ground which was pressed by his
cbariot wheels was productive ol gold and blessings to men.
These stories come from the twenty-third book ol Posidonius.

¹ Str. iv. ι, ἱ 13. Cp. Justin. xxxii. 3, 510, who says that there were
rro,ooo pounds oi silser and r,5oo,ooo pounds oi gold.
¹ So ln Athen. iv. 37, p. ¹52· Strabo, iv. a, 5 3, calls him Lueris.
