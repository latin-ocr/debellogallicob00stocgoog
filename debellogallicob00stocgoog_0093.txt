ln ⁶6 and the following year C. Calpurnius Piso, the consul C. Calpur-
of 67, was proconsul in Gallia Narbonensis. He appears to have 'gffiwh
quelled some tumult there, as Cicero (ad Att. i. 13, l a) calls
him ‘pacificator Allobrogum! We must-suppose that Cisalpine
Gaul was also under his jurisdictioni, as Cicero, writing in 65,
when he was meditating his canvass for the consulship, tallrs
of taking an excursion to Piso as legatus between September
and the following January‚ owing to the importance of Gaul in
elections (ad Art. i. r, f a: op. Phil. ii. ξ 76).

In 64 Lucius Murena, who succeeded Cicero in the consul· nummu
ship, was propraetor in Gaul. One of the praises that Cicero ffffiw
bestows on him is that by his justice and diligence he enabled
his countrymen to recover bad dehts in Gaul ¹. When he
returned to Rome in 63 to canvass for the consulship, he left his
brother C. Murena in charge of the province as legatus (Cic.

Mur. ξ 89; Sall. Cat. aa). Gaul both within and without the

Alps was at this nme in a disturbed state, and the discontent

of the people was being fomented by the emissaries of Catiline,

so that C. Murena had to throw a good many people into prison.

At Rome too an attempt was made to draw some envoys of the Partpuyed
Allobroges into the conspiracy. At first they were inclined to {2223ss
receive the proposal favourably, being willing to embarlr on olthe
desperate measures, if only they could free their country from fflffioe
debt: bnt afterwards they thought better of the matter, and it was spiraey ot
through their means that Cicero was enabled to convict Lentulus cethim.
and his associates at Rome. Rewards were voted to the

ambassadors of the Allobroges bythe Senate (Sall. Cat. 50, l r),
