His body seemed to be made of iron and to be incapable oi
feeling fatigue. His skill in arms was remarkable. ι He oorrld
ride a horse with his hands behind hie back, and could swim
rivers when they came in bis way. He would travel by post as
much as a hundred miles a day, taking his sleep iu the vehicle.
He reached the thne from Rome in aweek, and Furtber Spaiu‘
from Rome in twenty-four days. It was on one of his hurried
journeys across the Alps, after holding the assises in Cisalpine
Gaul, that his treatise on grammar was composed (Suet J. C.
56, y: Plut. Caes. 17). His health was not naturally good, as he
was liable to epilepsy, adisease from which he suffered first at
Corduba, and by which he was twice interrupted in the trans·
action of business. But this morbid tendency was fought down
by his tremendous physical activity, which left him no unte to

with debt himself, he had half his countrymen in debt to him.
He never scrupled to buy support, whether by extravagant
outlay or by direct bribery. The wonder is where all the money

he was there, was a very cave of Adullam, where every social
outcast and bankrupt debtor was sure to find a welcome and
assistance. While he used his countrymen to conquer the
Gauls, he was at the same time using the spoils of the Gauls,
as Plutarch epigrammatically puts it, to conquer his countrymen.
