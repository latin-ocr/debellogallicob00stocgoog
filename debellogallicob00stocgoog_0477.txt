used them to coerce waverers Their own sense of their services
was so great that they claimed the supreme command as against
Ariovistus But in a council of all Gaul held at Bibracte the
national hero was confirmed ln his position hy a unanimous vote
of the people. lle pursued his old tactics of avoiding a general
engagement and trying to starve the Romans out of the country,
bnt at the same time he supplied them with an additional motive
for leaving hy organizing attacks upon the Province. These were
resisted partly hy the provincials themselves and partly by 'Lucius
Caesar with twenty-two cohorts, who was acting as lieutennnt to
his cousin. The Proconsul himself, blocked hythe Gauls frorn
communication with the Province and Italy, sought aid from
beyond the Rhine, and reinforced himself with that mixed cavalry
and infantry of the Germans, which he regarded as so effective.
Acting on the principle of assigning the best instrumenta to the
hest performers, Caesar substituted the horses of his own officers
for the poorer animals that these allier had brought with them.
‘ibe success which awaited him may be traced in great measure to
this piece of wisdom, since on subsequent ditioni occasions it was
the Germans who decided the fate of the day.

One of the most remarkable things in the story of the Gallic war
is the surprising turn of fortune that now followed. Caesar was in
full retreat to the Province, being somewhere on the horden between
Chamytagne and Franche Cornte (66, 5 2), when Vercingetorix
encamped within ten miles of him. So confident were the Gauls
in the superiority of their cavalry that the knights bound them·
selves by a solemn vow not to return to their homes till they
had ridden twice through the ranks of the enemy. Nevertheless,
the Gallic cavalry were utterly defeated, chiefly hythe aid of the
Germans, and Vercingetorix, despairing of holding the field, shut
himself up in the hill-fortress of Alesia

1f we had any certain clue to the locality of this last battle, we
should have some ground to go on from the text of the Com·
mentaries in determining the site of Alesia. As it is, we only know
that on the day after (altero die, 68, 5 a) a battle which took place
in the territory of the Lingones Caesar pitched his camp at Alesia.
Napoleon Ill makes out the battle to have talren place on the
Vingeanne, near Longeau; bnt this is pure conjecture and is out
of keeping with his own far better grounded view that Alesia is
