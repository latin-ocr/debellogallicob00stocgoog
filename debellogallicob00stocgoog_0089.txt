WARS Wrrlr THE GAULS 73

of the Arverni, who were then the leading people in Gaul, gninsa
and were at the head of a vast confederation, like that which ἓξὲξ
afterwards assembled under the standard of Vercingetorix. over e
suen olere or influence rs described oy suaso as having rm.
extended from the Pyrenees to the Ocean and the Rhine, and
as having reached southwards to Narbo and the confines of
Massilia (Str. iv. a, Μ). Βιιῑ notwithstanding the enormous
force which they collected ¹, they were defeated at the junction of
the Isere and the thne by an army of only 30,000 men. The
general in command was now Q. Fabius Maximus, the consul of
121. He was a grandson by blood of L. Paullus Macedonicus,
and he himself received the surname of Allobrogicus, and enjoyed
the reputation of being the first conqueror of Gaul (Amm. Marc.
xv. ra, 5 5: cp. Cic. Font. 5 36). Domitius was so jealous of the
surrender of the Gauls being made to Fabius, and not to
himself, that he enticed Bituitus ², the iring of the Arverni, into
aconference, and then sbipped him off to Rome. The Fathers
placed him at Alba, declaring that it was contrary to public
peace tolet him go back. They then asked to have his son
Congentiatus sent to thern too (Lis. Epit. lxi; Val. Max. ix. 6,
53, ‘de perfidia'). These victories were thought of such im·
portance that towers were erected on the spot to commemorate
them, contrary to the general practice of the Romans, and
on the scene of the later action¹ two temples were built, one
to Mars and ure other to Hercules (Str. iv. 1, ξ 113 Flor. i. 37).
We may assume that Domitius was the constructor of the ‘Via
Domitia‚’ which was repaired under the gowemorship of Fonteius
(Cic. Font ξ 18).

A great step was made towards the consolidation of the

³ lt is plain from the ancient historicus that the victory of Domitius
preceded that of Fabius, but the latter is entered first in the Fasti Trium·
phales, conules because Domitius stsyed behind ln Gaul. Velleius
