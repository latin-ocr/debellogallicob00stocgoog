128 cAESAR's GALLIC WAR

should say that the distance is 50 miles hythe shortest sea·
route from Gesoriacum¹ (iv. § 102).

What Tacitus (Agr. ιο) has to tellus as ιο the situation ol
Britain is that it lies over against Germany to the east and
Spain to the west, that it is within sight ol Gaul on the south,
but that its northern parts are beaten by a vast and open sea

Dio Cassius (xxxix. 50, l a) informs us that Britain is distant
lrom the mainland ol Belgium, at the country ol the Morini,
450 stades (ι- 56} Roman miles) at the shortest, and that it
stretches along the rest ol Gaul and almost all Spain, The
statement which has been already quoted from him as ιο the
breadth ol Britain is evidently the result os later information
obtained in consequence ol the operations of Severus.

To the Greeks and Romans accustomed to the almost tideless
scas ol the Mediterranean the ebb and flow os the Ocean was
a standing source ol marvel. Various theories were started to
account lor this strange phenomenon. Some thought that it
was caused hythe breathing ol the mighty being on whose
breast we dwell (Mela iii. § a). Cotta, who supports the
Academic position in Cicero’s De Natura Deorum, is content
ιο set down the regular recurrence ol the tides in Spain and
Britain to nature '.

To Pytheas is ascribed by Plutarch the creditos having
detected the connexion between the tides and the moon. This
theory is vaguety referred to on hearsay in the Aristotelian
De Mundo (iv. l 35). Mela (iii. § a) speaks ol the movements
of the tides and the moon as a notable case ol concomitant
variations. By Pliny (ii. ξ aaa) the cause ol the tides is
confidently declared to be the sun and moon. The same
author (ii. ξ 217) relates Pytheas to have recorded that above

¹ Gesoriacum, the modern Boulogne, is supposed to harchem built
just below the site os Caesar's Itium.
