DE BELLO GALLICO. LIB. ΙΙΙ 97

Crassus, he sent orders for battleships to be built in the Loire and
lor due preparations to be made lor a naval war. As soon as the
season of the year permitted, he came into Gaul himsell The
Veneti and their allies, some of whom had been letched even from
Britain, were equally active on their side, and their hopes of
success ran high. .

For {ear lest the example os a patriotic confederacy should prove
