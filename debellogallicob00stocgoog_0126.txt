120 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

alleged extent os his travels was incredible to begin with, seeing
that he was a private person and apoor man. ‘Even Hermes
himselh' added the historiari, ‘could not be believed, is he said
that he bad travelled so sar! In answer to this objection it
has been conjectured by modern writers that Pytheas may have
been seut out at the expense of the Massilian state, as Hanno
and Himilco were by Carthage. Strabo seldom mentions the
famous navigator without a sneer, and has no keener con-
troversial thrust to make at awriter whose views heis criticiaing
than to say that ‘he had believed Pytheas ¹.' He classes him
(p. roa) along with Euhemerus and Antiphanes' as a proies·
sional impostor, adding in another place (p. 295) that he had
used his knowledge of astronomy and mathematice to obtain
credence for fiction. As regards Thule Strabo himself lays
claim to no knowledge, but assumes that Pytheas must have
lied about it, because he had lied about places better known
(iv. 5, 5 5, p. ποι). But when we corneto inquire into the
specific charges laid by Strabo against Pytheas it is surprising
how little we can find to justify all this censure. One mis-
statement which he brings home to him is that the length oi
Britain was more than ao,ooo stades, or a,5oo Roman miles,
whichis certainly an enormous exaggeration. Another is that
Kent was several days' sail from Gaul (p. 63). This Pytheas
might very well have said in good saith, having noted the time
it took himself to get from the one coast to the other. We
do not know from what point he deserted the coast of Gaul
and made across to Britain.

In writing about Britain it is not neoessary to go into the
vexed question os Thule. Suffice it to say that Pytheas spoke
oi a country under that name as being ‘six days' sail to the
