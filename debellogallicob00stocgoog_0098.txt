Tm inhabitants oi this country were called Celti or Celtae,
Galli or Galatae. The last is merely me Greek form assumed
by the same name which the Romans expressed by Galli ¹. As
the Greeks called the Gauls Γαλάται, so they called their home
Γαλατία, whether it were in France, Italy, or Asia Minor. But
this name came into use at a comparatively late period;
originally the Greeks called the people Κιλααί and their country
Κιλιιιιήλ This latter is the name given to France in the
fragments oi Hecataeus which have been preserved to us
by the geographer Stephanus oi Byzantium, who lived about
a th0usand years later than the author he is quoting. We find
that Hecataeus was acquainted not only with Marseille, but also
withNarbonne,andwithatown called Ndpnemtherwise unknown‘.
Herodotus Hecataeus seems to have possessed more definite information
ἓξὲξ about Gaul than his follower Herodotus, who jumbles up
together the Danube, the Celts, the Pyrenees, and the Pillars
of Hercules ⁸. Still some important facts seem to emerge irom
the conlusing statements oi Herodotus, namely, thart the Danube
- was in his day considered to come from the country oi the Celm,
and that these Κιλτοί were the people who dwelt hurthest to the
west ol any in Europe with the exception oi one, whom he calls

the Cynesii or Cynetes (Hdt. ii. 333 iv. 49).

says that it had no silver.
