strength ot With regard to the legion itselfthe chief question to be asked
‘¹¹‘ ΨΜ· is-Hov many men did it contain? if any one vere to ask
horr many men there are in an English regiment, it would
be impossible to return a precise and definite ansver. The
Romans vere a far more systematic people than the English:
nevertbeless, we must not be surprised that the answer to such
a question isa somewbat basy one. We seem on firm ground
when Polybius (i. 16, § a) begins by telling us that the Romans
were in the habit of raising every year four legions consisting
each of 4000 foot and 3οο horse. But later on (iii. roy,§ ιο)
he alters this statement as far as the horse are concerned,
making the usual number to be aco, but adding tbat in
emergencies the legIon consisted of 5000 foot and 300 horse.
As this statement is confirmed by Livy (xxii. 36, 5 3), we may
accept it as an improvement on the former. This ordinary
legion of 4000 infantry, which is perhaps a round number for
4200, was called ‘legio quadrata* (Festus, p. 336). In the
time of Marius the normal number of the infantry was raised to
6200. The cavalry are never expressly stated to be more than
300: butas there were ten ‘turmae’ in the ‘ala' of Roman
horse, this may again be a round number for 33ο. In Appian
Mith. γε, we get 3²0 horse as the average oi five legions under
Lucullus.
