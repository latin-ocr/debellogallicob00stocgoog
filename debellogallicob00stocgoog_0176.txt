172 cAESAR's GALLIC WAR

Herses The small size of the German horses has been already alluded
to. They were ugly and possessed of no great speed, but
they made up for these deficiencies by their powers ofendurance ¹.
They were ridden barebacked, the German regardinga saddle
as a sign of effeminacy (iv. a, 5 4). They were rather means
of locomotion than aids in actual fighting. For, when serious
work had to be done, the rider would dismount atid stab his
opponent's horse under him, tntsting to find his own trained ’
animal waiting for him on his return (iv. 2, ξ 3; 12, ξ a). It was
thus that the cavalry of the Usipetes and Tencteri, though them·
selves not more than 800, put to ssight 5900 of Caesar's horse.

Tacitus pronounces that on the whole the strength of the

an Germana lay in their infantry rather than in their cavalry, and

cav . gives this as tbe reason why they combined the two in the
· ‘hundreds' (G. 6,§ 5). Caesar (i. 48, §l 5-7) bas described
with admiration this mixed force as used by Ariovistus. In the
army of that chief there were 6,000 cavalry, supported by the
same number of infantry, the swiftest and strongest that could
be found, each ‘man picked by man,' and cbosen by the
horsemen with the care which was likely to be displayed in
a matter where their own safety was at stake. The leot-soldiers
were such practised runners that, aided by the manes of the

horses, they could keep up with their pace.

Although this mixture of cavalry and infantry is dwelt upon
by Caesar and Tacitus in special connexion with the Germans,
yet tbe practice was not confined to them. Vercingetorix bad
light-armed infantry mingled with his cavalry (vii. 18, § 1); the
‘Trimarcisia' described by Pausanias among the Gauls that
invaded Greece was instituted on asimilar principle (see p. 59);
and at a period less remote from Caesar’s time (nc. 168)
a body of Gauls under Clondicus, consisting of ro,000 cavalry

and the same number of infantry, who could equal the speed of
the horses and were ready to take the place of the riders if they
