112 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

vatem, could transform themselves into what animala they would,
could cure the incurable, could reveal the future, but refused to
do so to any save those who had come to their island for no

other purpose than to consult thern (Mela iii. § 48). There
were also suange rites among the women of the Namnetes.

On an island at the mouth of the Loire, on which no male foot
might tread, they held strange orgies to Bacchus, ·or whatever
deity corresponded to him in the Celtic Pantheon. Once a year
it was their custom to unroof the temple of their deity, and re-

roof it again the same day before the sun went down. Each ,

woman came laden with her burden, but if any let it slip, the
rest would turn upon her like a paclr of hounds and rend ber
limb from limb. Such at least is the story told by Artemidorus
(Str. iv. 4, § 6).

People who are shoclred at the idea of human sacrifices

· among a race who are more or less responsible for us, and for

whom we therefore feel responsible, bave tried to explain away
Caesar’s account of human sacrifices in connexion with the
Druidic religion (vi. τό) as referring to an epoch earlier tban his
own There is nothing however to countenance the notion tbat
Caesar's account is not strictly contemporary. When he is
referring to a time prior to his own, he is careful to tell us s0,
as in vi. 19, 53, where be says that the custom of buming
favourite slaves and retainers on the pyre of a chief was already
a thing of the past. In spite of the sostening of manners which

, we bave already bad occasion to notice between the time of

Posidonius and that of Caesar, there seems no reason to doubt
but that human sacrifices were a frequent practice in Gaul at
the time of the conquest. Religion is such a conservative force
that people who are otherwise civilised will not sbrink from
committing atrocities under its sanction. The dogma that
‘unless for the life of man man’s life be rendered, the will
of the Immortal Gods cannot be appeascd' (vi. 16, f 3) was
rooted in the Celtic mind like a poison-plant ever ready to bear
fruit in death. Cicero in 69 nc. speaks of human sacrifices
