fffimy m necessary ior our purpose, we are now sree to dwell more

in eemr’r particularly on its constitution in the time oi Caesar. We shall
ωε· be obliged, however, osten to refer bach to an earlier state

oi things in elucidation ol a later one.

(r) ln Iret us begin with the main divisions of the army.

mm* What we may call the table of the Roman army appears
in its familiar iorm as iar back as Cincius Alimentus. In the
sixth book oi his De Re Militari (Aul. Geli. xvi. 4, § 6) it
is given by that author in a ionn which we may put as
follows :-

2 centuries make r maniple.
gmaniples „ rcohorn
ro cohorte „ rlegion.

To the above table there might be added another denomina-
tion, namely,thattwo legions with their contingente oi allice maire
one consular army. Such at least vas the practice in old
times, when it was usual to euroll four legions, two lor each
consul

Meentngot The word ‘exercitus' by its very meaning carries us straight

‘mm’ to' the secretos Roman success ¹. It was naining and skill
that a Roman army matched against the svarming multitudes ol
the Gauls, against the big limbs oi the Germans, against the
wiliness of the Africans, against the intellect ol the Greeks
(Veget i. ι). The courage oi experience is more effective on
the field ol battle than that ol native spirit When a manis
confident that be has learnt to do a thing nell, including the
murder oi his brother, he takes a pride in putting it into
practice.

‘Legio’ is derived by Varro from ‘legere' in which case
