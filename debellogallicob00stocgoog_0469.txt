DE BELLO GALLICO. ΜΒ. VII 239

proceeded to lay siege to Gorgobina, the town of those Boii who
had been settled on Aeduan territory ti. 28, ᾗ 5). This movement
on the part of Vercingetorix put Caesar in a great difficulty. On
the one hand he could not with credit desert the dependente of the
Aedui, on the other the season was still too early to make it easy
to obtain supplies. The loss of prestige appeared the greater of
the two evils: so Caesar sent word to the Boii that he was coming
to their relief, and set out from Sens with eight legions. N ert day
he arrived at Vellaunodunum, a town of the Senones, which he
stopped to talre. Two days more brought him to Cenabum on the
boire, which belonged to the Carnutes. This town he sacked and
burnt. Thea he crossed the Loire and laid siege to a town of the
Bituriges called Noviodunum, which lav in his lineos march.
‘sbis was iu the act of surrender when the cavalry of Vercingetorix,
who had now raised the siege of Gorgobina, came to its relief ε
but these were routed by some German horse in Caesar’s service,
of whom we now hear ior the first time, and the surrender was
completed. After these successes Caesar marched upon Avaricum,
the chief town of the Bituriges, feeling sure that, if he could recover
that, bc would reduce the tribe into his power.

There has been much dispute as to the topography of this march
of Caesar's. Agedincum, it is not questioned, is Sens. Vellauno-
dunum is placed by the commission, whom Napoleon 111 instructed
to draw up a map of Gaul, at chamo-Laudem on the south border
of the department of Sciunt-Mam, but bv the Emperor himself
at Trigueres. Genabum is identified by the same Commission
with Orleans, by the Emperor with Gien, which is further up the
inire. Noviodunum is put by the Commission at Neuvy·sur·
Baranjon, by Ghler at Nouan le Fueelier, by N apoleon at Sancerre.
Gorgobina, for which Gergovia used to be read, is placed by the
Commission at Salat-PienedeMoutier, by Gbler at Guerchesur·
l’Aubois, by Napoleon at Sciat-Parize le Chatel. M. Desjardins
believes that the Cenabum of vii. 11, 14 is not the sameas the
Genabum of vii. 3 audv viii. 5. The latter place he identifies
with Orleans, and maintains that it should he spelt with a C,
because it is so spelt in an inscription found on the spot and by
Ptolemv (ii. 8, h 13), though not by Strabo (iv. a, ᾗ 3). The
former, he is willing with the Emperor to plaoe at Gien. This
compromise has little to recommend it Even if Orleans were out
