vere themselves superior oo foot. They accordingly trained
young and active meo, carrying each a buclaler and seven darts
(⁴ iacula ⁹) with points like those used by the ‘velites’ to ride
behind the cavalry-soldier and dismount uben they came to
the scene of action. This device is said to have been invented
by a centwino, Q. Navius, vho received honours in consequence
from the genero Fulvius Flaccus. After this time ‘velites' in
this special sense were made an integral part of the Roman
legions (Liv. xxvi. 4 3 Val. Marcii. 3, ξ 3). This mixed force,
which combined the velocity of cavalry with the stability of
infantry, was found extremely effective in Macedonia against
King Philippus (oc. aco) ². We read also of mounted ‘velites'
being employed by Metellus against Jugurtha in ac. ¹09
(Sall J. 46), but alter this they disappeared, when the whole
legion was made uniform by Marius. It seemed therefore to
Caesar a new idea when he encouotered such a force among
the Germane, and he was not slow in avalling himself of it
(vii 65, §43 viii. 13, ξ r). But the custom was Gallie as vell
as German. Livy (xliv. 26) describes it among the Gauls in
Illyricum, and Cacsar himself mentions its use by Vercingetorix
(vii. 18, ξ 13 cp. 80, i 3). Vegetius (iii. 16) speaks of the
employment of ⁴ velites' as an excellent device for strengthening
cavalry and aa being in accordance with the costum of the
ancients, but he is mistalren when he tells us io another place
(iii. ²4) that it nas these mounted ‘velites' that were employed
against elephanta
At the same time that the ‘velites' disappeared, the whole Sorvtval ot
tripertite organizatioo of the army was swept away. But Rome ffl‘fflssls
never broke entirely with the past, so thatin Cacsar's ume ve time
find the once famous names of ‘hastati' ‘principes’ aod ‘ularii'
still surviving in the titles of the centurions.
