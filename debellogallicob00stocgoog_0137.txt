BRJTAIN 131

climate is more temperate than that ot' Gaul, that is, neither so
hot nor so oold Strabo (iv. 5, i a, p. roo) adds that there is
more rain than snow‚ and speaks oi the long continuanee os
mist, and bow during the whole day the sun is sometimes visrble
only for three or four hours about noon Somewhat the same
observation as to the amence oi sunshiue might be made by
a visitor t'rom Italy now ; but there must have been still more
cause ior it then, before the country had been cleared ol woods
and marshes. Tacitus (Agr. ra) speaks to the same effect as
to the frequency ol mist and cloud, but adds that there is no
extreme cold. 1r the climate even oi South Britain was darlr
and sunless in those days, how much more must this have held
true oi Caledonia! There, says Herodian (iii. 14), ‘the air
appears always murky‚' a lact which he attributes to the
exhalations from the marshes

'lhe comparative mildness of the British climate is attributed
now to the Guli Stream as its cause. Oi this the Ancients
knew nothing, but they held that the sea contained beat in itseli

like an animal body (Cic. N. D. ii. 5 26). Minucius Felix
adduces as one oi the proois of a Divine Providence the way
in which the deficiency os sunlight in Britain was compensated
by the warmth os the sea that flowed round it ¹.
The length os the summer days and conversely the shortness length

ol the nights‚ was a salient feature of Britain in the eyes ol the mer

Ancients¹. lt was a point that attracted especial interest, drys.
because their men ol science had already arrived on a priori
grounds at the conviction that this must be so, and that at the
North Pole there must be day and night lor six months con-
tinuously. It had been ascertained that at Meroe in Aethiopia
the longest day was something over twelve equinoctial hours, at
Alexandria fourteen‚ and in Italy fifteen. By Pliny's time it had
been determined that the longest day in Britain was seventeen
