couching posture (Varr. L. L. v. §89; rest Muti, p. 306). This

The three divisions were arranged in quincuncial order, unless mange·
there were some reason to the contrary, as when Scipio at Zama ffisslfeghe
posted the maniples of each directly behind those of the other, ’
so as to leave a free passage lor the elephants (Polyb. xv. 9, §7 ;

The ‘velites' did ycoman’s service in the attaclr upon the The
Galatians on Mount Olympus in nc. 189, in connexion with '‘¹³²⁰‘'
which operation Livy (xxxviii. ar,§ 13) takes occasion to
