seem, oi thirty-three meu each, including the offioers ¹. From
each of tbese troops three men were selected as commanders
(ἱλάρχαιῂ these in their turn selected three others to look aiter
the rear. Tbese subordinate officere are called by Polybius
οὐραγοί, but their proper Latin name was ‘optiones ¹.' Tbe
offieer first selected had the command ol the wbole troop; the
second and third were in a strict sense commanders of ten
(διιόδαρχοι), but all three were called decurione (demptam
‘decirio¹), and the whole ‘turma' was regarded as consisting
oi three ‘decuriae' In the absence ol the first officer the second
took the command oi the troop. The origin oi this organisation
is traced back by Varro to the three primaeval tribes oi Rome,
which puts it ou alevel with that ol the primordial legion.
Varro notices thatin his own dune, which was also Caesar’s
time, the ‘optiones' were no longer selected by the decurionis,
but appointed by the tribunes, a change which he attributes to
the spread os patronage and favouritism.

The weak point about the Roman cavalry was originally the
insufficiency os their armour. They wore no breastplates, but
only hands round tbe vaist, like those oi the common soldier.
While this light equipment enabled them to mount and dis
mount with facility, it at the same time rendered an encounter
extremely hazardous. Moreover their spears were so slender
that the heads sometimes broke off from the mere motion oi
the horses, and, as they vere destitute os a spike at the otber
end (σαυρωτήρ), all use was gone from them when this happened.
Lastly, their shields oi cowhide were not strong enough lor the
press of battle, and were liable to rot irom damp. These deiects
had been remedied before the time oi Polybius (vi. 25) through the
adoption by the Romans of the lull cavalry armour oi the Greeks.

The cavalry used to charge in their ‘turmae' in close order ⁸,
