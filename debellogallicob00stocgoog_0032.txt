4 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

us by attributing it to another writer. Lastly‚ ior some at
least oi the events narrated, Xenophon is not the sole original
authority, sor an account was given ol' the battle oi Cunaxa
and oi many incidents relating to Clearchus by Ctesias the
Greek physician oi Artaxerxes (Xen. Anah. i. 8,§ 26: Plut.
Artox.11).

Another partial parallel that might be adduced is the account
by Josephus of the Jewish War, and especially os the siege
oi Jotapata, the delente ol which he conducted in person;
but that did not pass unchallenged in his own time, as he
shows by his acrimonious references to the rival historiam
Justus of Tiberias. ’

This unique advantage possessed by Caesar has been used
by him with an admirable discretion. It is difficolt, in any
case, to read a story without sympathizing with the hero.
But in this particular case the story is told with such an air
of truthiulness, and with such a winning grace and modesty,

 

that our admiration for Caesar is sar more enhanced
than if he had exhausted all the resources of rhetoric, as
Cicero would have done in his place, in tmmpeting his own
praisea.
Paucity οἱ But what was Caesar’s advantage is our disability in seelring
{ffiff to form a critical estimate os the truth oi his narrative. We

have hardly any means oi getting behind his statements or

ps bringing independent evidence to bear upon them. The
most detailed account that we have oi the Gallie War, other
than Caesar's own, is contained in certain chapters oi Dio
Cassius, books xxxviii-11¹. But then, when did Dio Cassius
live? He wrote in the reign oi Severus (xxxix. 50 ad fin),

¹ xxxviii. 31-50, the campaign against the Helvetians and Ariovistus3
xxxix. 1-5. the campaign against the Belgae; 40-53, the campaigns against
the Veneti aud the Aquitaniam, the passage of the Rhiue, and the first
invasion of Britain, xl. 1-11, the second invasion of Britain, the destruction
oi Cotta and Sabinus, the deienoe ol his camp by Quintus Cicero, and the
success oi labienus against the Trevirl; 31-43, the pursuit oi Anibiorix
and the suppression oi the great revolt in Gaul.
