208 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

ol communication between the men and the commender-in·
chief (i. 41, 55 a, 3; Tanrh ‘a 19, 5 4). They were superior
officers to the oenturlons ¹, by whom the rough work ol com·
mand was princlpnlly done. In iii. 7, 5 3 we lind them sent
out by Crassus along with the praelecta to get supplies It
may have been on some work of this kind that Marcus Aristius
was engaged at Chilon-sur·Sadne, when he was caught by the
revolt ol the hedui (vii 42, 5 5).

The Pras The term praelect (ί praefectus') is every loose one. It may

be said to be a general name t‘or any subordinate officer, who has
not a more definite title. It was used more especially ol the
commanders ol the auxiliary forces. These latter are perhaps the
praefecta who are spoken ofin the following passages—i 39, 5 a ς
iii. 7,5 35 iv. aa,5 3. Like the tribunes, they were Roman knights
But besides these officers there were others, called also ‘praefecti'
who were not necessarily Romans (iii. 26, 5 13 iv.1r‚ 5 6). In
viii. ιι, 5 4 we find Vertiscus, a chieltain oi the Remi, described
as ‘praelectus equitum! He did not, we are told, let his age
interiere with bis undertaking the ‘praefectura' (5 5). In the
same way, in the time ol the Italian ‘socii' there were praelecta
who were not Romans (Liv. xxv. 14, 5 4).

We come now to the officers who formed the real backbone

ο ’ of the army, and who were themselves the most characteristic

produnt ol the Roman military system—I mean the centurione.
The philosophioal Greek, who has described this system for us,
has caught the Roman ideal in bis sketch ol what the centurions
were expected to he—‘ not so much daring and adventrnous, as
men with a turn lor oommand, oi a steady disposition, and with
no moral shallowness about them¹ ; their place was not in the
first assault nor their time the beginning oi the hay, but, ii
