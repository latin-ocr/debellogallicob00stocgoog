effective aiter-dinner speaker, if only he could have got out
on the spur of the moment the things that occurred to him
afterwards when he was going home in his cab. This great
advantage is possessed by all the characters of antiquity, down
rothe merest satages, that they are credited with having said
impromptu whatever could be devised for them hythe most
brilliant writer in his study. For the speeches were the field
in which the historiari displayed his wit or the want of it,
and in which he let it be seen how much he had profited
by those rhetorical exercises which formed the staple of
education among the Ancients. lf there happened to be
abacis of recorded speech to go upon, the writer might as well
derive a happy sentiment from that source as from another;
but the direct aim in these compositions was not historic truth
but drammic propriety, or what the writer, if he were a dull
man, mistook for the latter. Dio Cassius had before him the
brief but vigorous speech which Caemr recorda himself to have
addressed to his officers before the engagement with Ariovistus
(B. G. i. 4o); newertheless he thinks proper to put into his
mouth an interminable harangue (xxxviii. 36-46) which, with
its review of the wars df Rome and its imitations of Demosthenes,
bears not the slightest resemblance to the original, except the
touch about the tenth legion at the end.

The speeches in Caesar are almost entirely in the oblique
oration, a form of composition which, while detracting from
their vividness, imparts at the same time an air of vensimiltmde,
as though they were reports of what had actually been said,
as no doubt they to some extent wele. The only important

speech which is given in the direct oration isvthat of Critognatus
(Β. G. vii 77), during the siege of Alesia, which Caesar could
not pretend to have heard. Other small bits of direct oration
are introduced for liveliness, as in ν. 303 44 ξ 3: vt's, §i 3, 4 ;
