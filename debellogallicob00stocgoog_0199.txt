this legion as taking part in both the expeditione to Britain

(iv. 32, 5 13 v. 9, 5 7); it was afterwards with Labienus at
Paris (vii. 62, 5 3). The Xllth legion under Servius Galba was
exposed to great danger in attempting to pass the winter of
sc. 56-7 near Martigny (iii. 1, 5 1); it too was at Paris with
Labienus.

nt the time of the second expedition to Britain the number
of Caesar's legions is still eight. There were three 'leti with
Labienus, while five accompanied Caesar himself to Britain
(v. 8. 5 ι). In the unquiet winter which followed (nc. 54·3)
there were apparently eight and a·half legions quartered about
the country (v. 24), but we may fairly infer that the five extra
cohorte intrusted to Sabinus and Cotta were eontIngents drawn
from the rest of the army and were meant to impart strength to
the legion of tiros which was being sent into the country of the
Eburones (v. 24, 5 4). These fifteen coborts were lost at
Atuatuca, but in place of thern thirty cohorte, or three new
legions, were brought into Gaul (vi. 1, 5 4). The entire legion
which perished must have been XIV, for in w. 24, 54 Caesar
speaks of itas one of those which he had most recently levied
beyond the Padus. It is only XIII and XIV which answer
to this description, and we know that XIII passed the winter
safely among the Esuvii under the command of Lucius Roscius
(v. 53, 5 6). of the three new legions one took tbe place and
number of the lost XIVth (vi. gr, 5 53 viii 4,5 3), whose ill·
fortune it inherited, for two of its cohorts were destroyed at
the same camp of Aduatuca by the unexpected incursion of
the Sugambri (vi. 37,§ 83 44, 5 1); another was the Ist, lent
by Pompeius (viii. 54, 5 2; C. iii. 88, 5 13 Lucan vii. 218),
but which had been raised in Caesar's own province of Cisalpine
Gaul (wi. 1, 5 ι; viii. 54, 5 2); the third we must suppose
to have been the XVth. The two legions last mentioned,
Iand XV, were those that were sent by Caesar, in accordanee
with the decree of the Senate, as though to the Parthian war.
They formed the left wing under Pompeius himself at the battle
