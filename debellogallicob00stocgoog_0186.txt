directly conoemed. Oi the first period we shall touch only on

the close.

‘neom ‘hastati’ occupied the iront rank and were the youngest oi
‘'mmm'‘ the heavyarmed troops, the ‘triarii' being the veterans. In
addition to these there were light-armed troops l‘selites'), who
consisted of the youngest men and were distributed equally

‘principes’ aud apparently also the ‘velites' were 1200 each,
which brings the total up to 4200. Ila larger legion were
required, the additional men were distributed equally among all
the divisions except the ‘triarii' These differed from the
‘hastati’ and ⁴ principes' in not carrying the ‘pilum’ but being
armed with what Polybius (i. agi 16) calls δόρατι Yet the
‘uiarii' were otherwise known as ‘pilani'.' Beyond this differ·

alike. They bore the ‘scutum' the Spanish sword on the right
thigh, brazen helmets and greaves. The majority wore besides
