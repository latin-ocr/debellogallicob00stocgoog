its material ¹.

· Ol grenves (‘ ocrese') there is no mention in Caesar. From
Vegetius (i. ro) we guther that they were worn by the common
soldiers only on the right shin This points to the lect thst
it wss the right leg which was advaneed in combet ¹.

· The soldier's bob-nailed boots l‘ caligae ') have been already
ulluded to. It was lrom these that the emperor Gsius got his
sobriquet ol Caligula, when, ss a child, he was the soldiers'
petio Germsny.

As s protection from the westher the soldier wore a thick
woollen closk caleo ‘sagumj which ended in n lringe
(‘ fimbria‚' Varr. L. L. w. l 79). This moy have been originally
horrowed lrom the Gauls (ν. 42, 53), but it becsrm as dis
tinctive ol the Romans in war ss the ‘toga' was in pesce.
When s ‘tumultus' was deelared, it wss worn even by those
who were not actually in the fieldt We see from a passage
in the Civil War (i 75, i 3) that it could be used in emergenoies
ss a protection, wrspped round the leit arm, in place ol a shield.

The two offensive weapons carried by the legionary were the
jevelin l‘pilum') and the sword (gladius). The former was

a round ol musketry preluding a charge with the bayonet⁴.

'ibe ‘pilum' which wns a distinctively Italian weapon, was
much heavier dian the ‘hasta,' several ol which were carried by
a single light-armed combatant ⁸. It was eslled hythe Greeks
