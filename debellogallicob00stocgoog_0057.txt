WARS Wrffl THE GAULS 35

Bellovesos the smiling phiris of Italy. Thither he set out with
the redundant manhood of six tribes of Gaul-the Bituriges,
Arverni, Aedui, Ambarri, Carnutes, and Aulerci. But when
they came within sight of the Alps, of which history records no
previous crossing, unless we are to regard Hercules as historical,
it is no wonder if these men of the plains were inclined at first
to regard their sky-clad summits as inaccessible. Just‘ then
they heard that there was war between the Salyes and some

they hailed the omen-for this was the name of one of the

Santoni. Close on the heels of this first band of invaders came
motha with the consent of Bellovesus. These were the Ceno·
mani, under their leader Etitovius, who occupied the parts
where Brixia and Verona afterwards stood ¹. After this there
was an immigration of Libui² and of Salluvii, the latter the

selves on the banis of the Ticinus, near the Laevi, another tn'be
of Ligurian origin. These were followed, but at what interval
of time we do not know, by the Boii and Lingones, who struck
