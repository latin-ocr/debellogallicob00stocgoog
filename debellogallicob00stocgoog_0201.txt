But now a difficulty emerges For in viii. 4, 5 3 Hirtius Difficuuy

mentions a legion VI, which we have never heard of before, ἴδω ⁰¹¹⁶

and mentions it too in a way which shows that it was one of ψ
those engaged ln the siege of Alesia (cp. vii. 90, 5 8).
Napoleon III surmIses (vol. ii. p. 357, n.) ‘that it had remained
in garrison among me Allobroges or in Italy’ 3 Gdler (i. 333)
suggests that VI is here a mistalre for 1. On the whole perhaps*
we should do better to follow me latter view. Only there is no
need to suppose a mistalre. There Is no mention ln Caesar's
narrative of legion 1. The sole mention we have of it is by
Hirtius (viii. 54, 5 a), who is speaking for the moment from the
point of view of Pompeius, and doubtless gives it the number
which it bore in the army of that general. lf we accept tius
identification of I and VI, we are relieved from an awkward
breach of continuity and have an uninterrupted series of ten
legions in Caesar's army from VI to XV. Another presumption
in favour of this hypothesis is that, if Caesar, as we have seen
reason to believe, had only legion XII with himself at Bibracte,
there is no room for legion 1 iu the account of winter-quartem
in vii. 903 since by a comparison of texts we can assign thdr
proper legions to the several commanders. For hIs expedition
against me Bellovaci Caesar drew two legions from Fabius,
which were all he had, and one of his two from Labienus
(viii. 6. § 3). These three legions we find were VII, VIII, and
IX (viii. 8, 52). Let us suppose that VII and VIII came from
Fabius. This leaves IX to Labienus, and we know thu his
other legion was XV (viii. 24, 53). C. Antistius Reginus had
XI (vii. 90, 5 7, compared with viii. 2, 5 r); T. Sextius XIII (viii. 2,
5 1 ; ιι,5 r); Cicero and Sulpicius had XIV and VI (viii. 90, 5 8,
compared with viii. 4, 5 3); Caesar hImselfhad XII: it follows by
the method of residues that C. Caninius Rebilus had X Hence
Caesar’s statement in vii. 90 may be filled out thus :—
