display of some captured slaves, whom he passed off as Roman
soldiers compelled by famine to leave the camp. These captives
were made to say that Caesar had determined to draw off his army
in three days, if his operatione were not successful in the interval
The result vas that the Gauls threw10‚ooo men, picked out from
all their forces, into the beleaguered city, to assist the inhabitants in
the defence of this all-important post.

After this the siege was pressed with great vigour by the
Romans and resisted hythe Gauls with a skill and gallantry that
