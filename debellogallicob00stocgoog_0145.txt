BRITAIN 141

that the motivo for their hostility to Caesar was that they were
afraid of having their commerce interfered with by his desigus
on Britain. To them doubtless belonged the merchants (iv. ao,
ἦ 4) of whom Caesar inquired about Britain with so unsatisfac-
tory a result.

The commodity with which the name of Britain was chiefly The tin-
aaeociated in the ancient market was tin. We have the authority Μ’
of Posidonius for the statement that tin was brought from the
British Isles to Massilia (Str. iii. p. 147). Diodorus Siculus
(v. aa) has preserved an interesting account of the tin-trade in
a period anterior to Caesar. He says that the inhabitants of
Beleriurn (Cornwall) were extremely hospitable and civilised in
their way of life owing to their intercourse with foreign mer-
chants. They procured the tin, skilfully working the ground
which bore it This was rocky‚ but had strata of earth,in which
they worked the produce, and then refined it by smelting. It ·
was afterwards shaped into bloclrs like dice, and conveyed to an
island which lay ofi the coast of Britain, and was called lotis.
To this island there was access by land at low tide, and the tin
was carted thither in wagons From there it was bought by
the merchants and conveyed to Gaul. Finally a land journey
of about thirty days suffioed to bring the wares on horseback to
the mouth of the thne Α little further on (v. 38, l 5) Dio·
dorus again says that a great deal of tin was brought from
Britain to the opposite coast of Gaul, and then conveyed on
horsebaclr by the merchants through the interior to Massilia
and the town called Narbo.

It is impossible to leave these passages without venturing
a lew remarks on them. First, who was tbe author from whom
Diodorus bonowed his account of the British tin-trade? Just
before the second passage which has been quoted, Diodorus
had been correcting an error of some historians wbo bad
asserted that in Spain thetin was got from the surface, instead
of being mined for and smelted like silver and gold A com· ·
parison with Strabo serves to show that this remark is horrowed
