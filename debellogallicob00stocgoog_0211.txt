of the soldiers (Liv. vii. 5, 5 9); in 31¹ they advanced their
pretensions so far as to appoint sixteen for the four legions,
or two-thirds of the whole number (Liv. ix. 30, 5 3) ς in 207,
when there vvere no less than twenty-three legions in the field,
the peopie elected all the tribunes for the first four, but test
the rest to be appointed by the consuls (Liv. xxvii 36, 55 12-
14). Livy (vii. 5, 5 9) mentions that in his own day the
tribunes appointed by the commandere were called ‘rufuli'
Asconius (on Verr. i. 5 30) adds that the elected tribunes were
called ‘comitiali'

Thus we see that twenty-four of the tribunes vvere appointed

by the people‚ and the tenure of this command was with many
the first rung on the ladder of official promotion. The elder
Africanus was a tribune at an early age, but he, we may sup·
pose, was appointed by his father (Liv. xxii. 53, 55 a, 3) 3
Marius first experienced the favour of the people in bis election
to this post by the tribes (Sall. J. 63, 5 4); Caesar himself, after
bis retirement to Rhodes und his escape from the pirates, began
his career at Rome by a successful contest for the military
tribunate (Suet J. C. 5: Plut Caes. 5).

ln Caesar's own time the appointment by the general was
evidently very much abused. His tribunes were not seasoned
soldiers, but personal adherente, whom he found it convenient
to lreep in good-humoure the panic about the Germane began
with them (i. 39, 5 a). We are let into tbe secret of'bovv
things were managed by reading Cicero's correspondence with
Trebatius, a very unmilitary person, for whom the oratoris
influente secured a sinecure appointment to the tribunate in
Caesar's army (cie. ad Fam. vii. 8,5 ι). Among all Caesar‘s
tribunes the only one wbo seems to have distinguished himself
much as a soldier was Gaius Volusenus (iii. 5, ξ a).

The tribunes are spoken of as Roman knights ¹. They were

mounted‚ certainly on the march (vii. 65, 5 5), and presumably
in the field also (i. 25, 5 ι). They formed the natural cbannel
