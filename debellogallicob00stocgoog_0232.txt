2 C. IULII CAESARIS

thus wholly in the country oi the Allobroges, but there was ewen
then a bridge connecting it with that ol tbe Helvetii. This bridge
it was Caesar's first care to break down. ln answer to a request
from the Helvetii that they might pass peaoeably through the
Roman province Caesar replied that he would take time to con-
sider the matter. ‘Come back to me,’ he said, ‘on the Ides of
April: Meantime with the one legion which was then in Further
Gaul and recruits which hebed levied on his arrival he contrived
by availing himself nt natural advantages to render the south
bank of the thne impregnable over the nineteen Roman miles
which is the distance in a straight line between Geneva and
the present Fort de l'Ecluse, or rather the Montagne du Vuache,
which faces it. When the Helvetian ambassadors returned on the
day appointed his answer was a decided refusal. Alter this they
attempted to force the passage, but iound the taslt too much lor

The supposed object nithe Helvetii was to reach the country ol

their presence there as likely to prove a danger to the Province;
lor, though as a matter os geography they would he further off

no natural obstacles to their progress on that side like that which
we have seen offered by the thne.

Accordingly leaving his chiel lieutenant Labienus to guard the
river, Caesar returned with all speed into Italy, that is, into

Cisalpine Gaul, levied two legions there, summoned out three
others that were wintering in theneighbourhood oi Aquileia, and
returned hythe nearest route into Gaul. This was hythe valley
nithe Po and the Pas de Suse (Segusio), which brought him into
the territory οἰ the Vocontii Having to fight his way against the
mountain-tribes, he was six days in coming from Ocelum, the last
