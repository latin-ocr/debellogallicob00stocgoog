they regarded as an impedimeut to crossing the marshes, by
which he apparently means the lirths. These barbarians are
described as most warlike and bloodthirsty, and as capable of
enduring all hardships and privations. Dio Cassius tells us that
they would bury themselves in the marshes lor days with their

that they could live in the woods on bark and roots; more,-
