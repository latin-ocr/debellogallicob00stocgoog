The value of Strabo is both direct and indirect. Boru himself
at Amasia in Pontus (xii. 3, ᾗ 39, p. 561) he had extended his
travels westward to Etruria, and southward to the borders oi
Ethiopia (ii. p. ιη). But no manin those days could hope to
see the whole world ior himseli, aud the best geographer was
he who could make the best use oi the materials supplied him
by others. Just as the several senses give their report of
a certain figure, colour, sire, smell, feel and taste, while the
mind combines thern into the uotion os an apple, so the intellect

apart irom Caesar, the authority upon whom he relied most is
Posidonius. That philosopher had himself visited Gaul and

this be so, it would fix the date of composition as n. n. 44 ; but
his latest editor sees reason to suppose that the allusion is rather
to the fantastic ireaks oi Caligula (Suet. Calig. 47). Pomponius
Mela is mentioned by Pliny among the authorities ior the three
books ol his great worlr which deal with geograpby.
