who had been consul in the preceding year, was slain by them
along with his legions¹. But Roman retribution was not long
delayed. The consul P. Cornelius Dolabella, who had set out for
Etruria, turned aside through the country of the Sabines and
Picenum, and marched into the land oi the Senones ¹, from which
the hullt of its natural detenders were absent. Here he slew all
the adult males except Britomaris, who was reserved for triumph,
enslaved the women and children, and so devastated the country

both nations were defeated with great slaughter by Dolabella on
the banks of the small lake of Vadimo, above the junction
of the Nar with the Tiber. Finding themselves defeated again

invaded, not the invaders. The founding of Ariminum in

sc. 268 (Eutr. ii. ιδ), just below the Rubicon, is a permanent
sign of this tum of the tide. But there is a long lull in the
contest before the Romans address themselves to the taslr of
conquering tbe Cisalpine Gauls. The Gauls during this period
were glad enough to be let alone, and the attention of the
