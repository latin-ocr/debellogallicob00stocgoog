acting at a dutance srom his superior Caesar takes care to give
him full credit for his achievements, as he does to all the officers
who acted under him. ln the matter ol the Usipetes and
Tencteri Caesar has not misstated or ooncealed the lacts. What
he has done is to seek to palliate his own conduct by attributing
atreacherous motive to his antagonists. Os this we have uo
proof but Caesads bare assertion, and it appears extremely
improbable from the facts as related by himself.

Ethnogrr· When we turn from the actual history oi Caesar's campaigns

ffiffl to the ethnographical and geographica! notices which lend so

entnotiees much charm to his writings, we find ourselves much better
supplied with extraneous information.

Diodorus The author nearest to Caesar's own time is Diodorus Siculus.

Siculus ’ He is supposed to have written aher the year an. 8, but his lise
overlapped that of Caesar, as he speaks of having been alive
himself when Caesar built the bridge across the Rhine (v. 25,
54). His ‘Historical Library,' which has come down tous
only in part, seems to have stopped short ofCaesar's Gallie War.
We may surmise that the work was interrupted by death, as
he twice expresses the intention to treat of Caesar's invasion oi
Britain (v. ar,§a; ης ι). But iu the fifth book, which is
extant, and which deals mainly with islands, he has lest us an
account ol Britain and os its trade in tin (chs. aa, 23). Fortu·
nately lor us also he has thought it suitable to his design to
throw in an acoount of Gaul and its inhabitants (ebs. ²4·3²l
’ Strabo's birth is put at about nc. 66, so that his life also
overlapped that os Caesar. But he wrote during the early years
oi the reign of Tiberius, as is evident from many allusions¹. His
treatise on geography is by far the most valuable work of the
hind that has come down to us from antiquity. The first four

chapters os the fourth book are devoted to Transalpine Gaul;
