as we think of Russia ¹. Por this three reasons may be assigned
-one is the ingrained tendency to exaggeration which was
iostcred by the practice ol rhetoric; another, that the Alps
were the threshold of Gaul to the Italians, and affected their
ideas oi the whole country; the third is the lact that the
climate must really have been more rigorous then than· now, '
owing to the extentio which the country was covered with
woods and marshes. But more sedate writers, like Strabo
and Pliny, admit that the climate of Provence did not differ
from that os Italy. Sheltered between the Cdvennes and the
Alps, the basin oi the thne, which was, roughly speaking,
the Roman Provincia, bore, or was capable oi bearing, all the

what the traveller of the present day may observe, how the olive
tends to disappear as one mounts the slopes of the ccvennes.

trees No part os it was unproductive, save what was covered
with marshes (Str. iv. r, ξ a ; Mela iii. ξ 17). It abounded with
cattle ol various kinds, and enjoyeda marked absence of noxious
