DE BELLO GALLICO. ΜΒ. IV 125

himself against all contingencies. By using the materiale of twelve
of the ships that had been most damaged, and sending to the
Continent for tools‚ he succeeded in making the rest serviceable.

Meantime he daily carried into bis camp the crops of the people
with whom he was at peace. This was too much for the Britons.
They laid an ambnsh for the seventh legion while it was employed

in reaping, and it was only rescued from their war-chariots by the
timely arrival of Caesar with some cohorte on the scene. Then
followed heavy rains which quenched the ardour of both sides for
a time. After this the Britons attacked the camp, but were routed
and some loss inflicted on them by about thirty horsetnen, whom
Commius, king of the Atrebates, had brought over with him. On
the same day ambassadors again came to ask for peace Caesar

winter-quarters among the Belgae Two British states only kept
their promise to send hostages. For these exploits Caesar was
honoured with a thanksgiving of twenty days' duration

Out of all the controversy that there has been about Caesar's
invasion of Britain one conclusion seems to emerge clear, namely,
that Bonlogne, or at least the mouth of the hinne, was the port
from which he sailed. This theory survives as being the fittest,
