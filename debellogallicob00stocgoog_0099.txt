Herodotus is strictly in the right in saying that tbe Danube v eneas
comes from tbe country of tbe Celts, since its springs are near Ytszess'm
those of the Rhine andos the thne. But it is important to
eall attention to the extreme vagueness with which tbe name
Celt vas employed by the Greeks. Dio Cassius (xxxix. 49)
expressly tells us that in very early times the people who lived
on both sides of the Rhine were called Celts. He himself
affects precision by reserving the name Κελταί ior the Germana,
while calling the Ganls Γαλάται. Appian (iv. r, a) applies the
term ont indifferently to the Cisalpine Ganls and to their
T entonic and Cimbrian invaders. Diodorus Siculus, on the

other hand speaks of the Germans whom Caesar invaded as
‘the Gaulr who dwell across tbe Danube' (v. 25, §4). The
fact is that the German to the minds of the Ancients vas merely
an exaggerated and more barbarian Ganl. He was the genuine
article unsophisticated by any tincture of civilization, and hence,
according to an ancient writer, be was called ‘Germanus' by
theRomans Caesar himselffvi a4lseems inclined to something

of this view.

Amid such confusion of nomenclatore it nas clearlya gain Differen-
to bave the Gauls differentiated from the Germans hy the name ‘Gifffsfgm
Galli or ratam Pausanias assures us that this term was of Germane
quite late introduction ¹. In its Greek form it occurs first in
a fragment of Timaeus (about nc. 264), in Latin in a fragment
of Cato (died nc. 1⁴9)-

Strabo says that originally the inhabitants os Narbonitis only Narrower
were oalled ΚεἋται, and that from thern the name spread (in the {¹¹53in of
form Κελταί) to tbe Gauls generally. He thinks that the influ-
ence of tbe Massilians helped to extend the name of the tribes
near them to those more remote. This accords with Caesar‘s
limited use of Celtae for the Gauls next to the Province, and

tbrows light on tbe statement of Diodorus (v. μ) ι) that only
