DE BELLO GALLICO. ΗΒ. VI! 243

including Eporedorix, Viridomarus, aad his own brothers, had
been put to death by Caesar on a charge of communicating with
the Arvernians. This assertion was at once believed, and some
Roman citizens who were with the foroe were tortured to death, the
army having made up its mind to join Vercingetorix. Meantime
however Eporedorix, who was alive and well, had informed Caesar
of the derigo, and the energetic Proconsul was down upon thern
with four legions and all his cavalry before they had advanced five
miles further. Litaviccus ssed with his personal followers to
Gergovia, while the Aedui threw down their arms and begged for
mercy. After allowing his soldiers three hours’ rest at night,
Caesar began his march back He was nret about half-way by
messengers from Fabius, who had been left in command, to tell
him that the camp had been attached in force during hio absence.
This news increased the alamity of the men, and these indomitable
campaigners arrived in camp before sunrise, having accomplished
fitty Roman miles in little more than twenty-four hours (39,§ 33

Th0ugh Caesar had at once sent messengers to the Aedui to tell
them how he had spared their men, yet the lie spread by Litaviccus
had already done its work. 'lhe property of Roman citizens had
been plundered and themselves enslaved or even killed. Α military
tribune, M. Aristius, had been brought out under a saie-conduct
from Cabillonum (Charon-sur-Saone) along with the Roman mer·
chants in the town, and then attached on the way. The party
defended themselves with vigour and were under siege night aad
day, when a sudden change was caused in the demeanour of the
Aedui hythe news that their men were in Caesar's power. The
state now took every means to exculpate itself, but too many
persons were implicated to allow ol the public repentance being
sincere. Caesar was well avare that his ancient allies were leav-
ing him, and his one anxiety now was to get away from Gergovia
and effect a junction with Labienus Some appearance of success
against the enemy before he went would make his retreat look less

ἃ a flight. An opportunity for this seemed now to present
ι .

On paying a visit to the smaller camp Caesar was surprised to
observe that a hill which was occupied by the enemy, though it

had been black with rnen the day before, was almost bare now.
