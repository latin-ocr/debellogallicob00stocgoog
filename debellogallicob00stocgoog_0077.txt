WAtts WITH THE GAULS 57

exiled by the Carthaginians and his goods confiscated in response
to a Roman embassy (Liv. xxxi. 19).

This victory ol Furius comes in between two defeats, one Operatione
in sor, when C. Oppius, the praesent os the allies, was slain ffiffi‘ ¹¹¹⁰
with 7,οοο men on a foraging party in the country of the Boii
(Liv. xxxi. a), another in 199, when the praetor Cu. Baebius
Tamphilus lost more than 6,6oo men in the territory ol the
Insubres (Liv. xxxii. 7). The year following (nc. 198) was
chiefly taken up by the Romans in compelling their colonists to
return to Placentia and Cremona (Liv. xxxii. 26). In 197 both
consuls were assigned legions to carry on war against the
Cisalpine Gauls (xxxii. 28) and Ligurians Among the iormer
we now find the Cenomani, at least the younger members of
the tnbe, ranged ou the side ol their countrymen. Alter this
the war went on with varying fortunes, with now some leat of
arms on the part of a Gallie chieitain, Corolamus or Dorulacus
or Boiorix, and again a triumph or thanksgiving among the
Romans, until the year 191, when it was terminated, as far as Triumph
the Gauls were contemed, by the complete submission of the 23²3?
Boii, who were mulcted oi about halltheir territory (xxxvi. 39l÷ Boii.
but the Liguriam, as we have already seen, carried on their
resistance to a much later date. So intimately were they con·
nected in the minda ol the Romans with the Gauls that when
Scipio Nasica claimed a triumph for his crushing deleat ol the
Boii, a tribune objected to it on the ground that the Gauls
would never be quiet so long as the Ligurians were in arms,
and that Scipio, instead oi coming home to claim a triumph,
ought at onoe to have brought aid to Q. Minucius, who had
been lor three years engaged in a doubtful struggle with the
Liguriam (xxxvi. 39). The tribune however was compelled by
the Senate to withdraw his opposition, and Nasica enjoyed
a rich triumph, in which 1471 golden torques were carried in
processiones well as a quantity oi gold and silver, both in the
form oi coin and bullion, and what are described as fairly
artistic vessels of native worlrmanship (Liv. xxxvi. 40).
