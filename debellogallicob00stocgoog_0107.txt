The oblong shield (θυρεός, D. S. v. 30, ξ α; Pane x. ar, ξ τ)
which they carried seems to have been only os painted wood,
though it might be ornamented with brass projections which
contribnted to strength. Even the protection afforded by clothes
was sometimes dispensed with, and the Gaul, who habitually
went elad would bare his white flesh sor battle ¹. We do hear
of breastplates of chain-armorrr being worn by the Gauls‚ but
on the whole the leebleness os their defensive armonr was
a source of weakness in their combats both with Greeks and
Romans. It is to the neglect of this source os salety at a later
period by the Romans themselves that Vegetius ascribes the
reverses they suffered at the hands ol the barbarians. The chief
aim ol their helmets seems to have been to increase the terrors
ol the wearer's appearance by their height, like the bearskins ol
oar grenadiers. They were adorned with the heads os beasts
and birds (Ι). S. v. 30, ξ a).

meet with these combats more than once in the pages of '
